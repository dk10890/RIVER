	abstract = {The impact of climate change on water resources is usually assessed at the local scale. However, regional climate models (RCMs) are known to exhibit systematic biases in precipitation. Hence, RCM simulations need to be post-processed in order to produce reliable estimates of local scale climate. Popular post-processing approaches are based on statistical transformations, which attempt to adjust the distribution of modelled data such that it closely resembles the observed climatology. However, the diversity of suggested methods renders the selection of optimal techniques difﬁcult and therefore there is a need for clariﬁcation. In this paper, statistical transformations for postprocessing RCM output are reviewed and classiﬁed into (1) distribution derived transformations, (2) parametric transformations and (3) nonparametric transformations, each differing with respect to their underlying assumptions. A real world application, using observations of 82 precipitation stations in Norway, showed that nonparametric transformations have the highest skill in systematically reducing biases in RCM precipitation.},

The R package GA provides a collection of general purpose functions for optimisation using genetic algorithms. This paper describes some enhancements recently introduced in version 3 of the package. In particular, hybrid GAs have been implemented by including the option to perform local searches during the evolution. This allows to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local optimiser. Another major improvement is the provision of facilities for parallel computing. Parallelisation has been implemented using both the master-slave approach and the islands evolution model. Several examples of usage are presented, with both real-world data examples and benchmark functions, showing that often high-quality solutions can be obtained more efﬁciently.},

The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979-2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

However, this superimposition is not conducive to identifying the drivers of Budyko parameter dynamics at different time scales, and thus affects parameter estimation. Here we obtain the Budyko parameter ω in the Fu’s equation (one form of the Budyko framework) for the Wei River Basin (WRB), and then adopt the Empirical Mode Decomposition method to reveal the relationships between factors and ω series at multiple time scales by considering the interplay among different influencing factors. Results indicate that (1) ω series are decomposed into 4-, 12-, 20-, exceeding 20-year time scale oscillations and a residual component with an significantly increasing trend in the mainstream of the WRB, a non-significantly decreasing trend in the Jing River Basin and Beiluo River Basin; (2) by analyzing the residual trend component, evaporation ratio, soil moisture and effective irrigated area are found to induce the significant increase of ω in the upstream of the WRB, whereas that in the middle and lower reaches is dominated by baseflow and Niño 3.4; (3) ω dynamics at the 4-year time scale is dominated by evaporation ratio, aridity index, baseflow and soil moisture; baseflow, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and sunspots attribute to the dynamics at 12-year time scale; all the factors except baseflow and soil moisture contribute to the dynamics at 20- or exceeding 20-year time scales. The results of this study will help identify the connection between watershed water-energy balance dynamics and changing environment at multiple time scales, and also be beneficial for guiding water resources management and ecological development planning on the Loess Plateau.},

To systematically investigate the connections between the two frameworks, we analyze precipitation, pan evaporation, and potential evaporation data at 259 weather stations across the United States. The precipitation and pan evaporation data are from field measurement and the potential evaporation data are collected from a remote-sensing dataset. We use pan evaporation to represent “apparent” potential evaporation, which is different from potential evaporation. With these data, we study the correlations between precipitation and potential evaporation, and between precipitation and “apparent” potential evaporation. The results show that 93 \% of the study's weather stations exhibit a negative correlation between precipitation and “apparent” potential evaporation. Also, the aggregated data cloud of precipitation vs. “apparent” potential evaporation with 5312 warm-season data points from 259 weather stations shows a negative trend in which “apparent” potential evaporation decreases with increasing precipitation. On the other hand, no significant correlation is found in the data cloud of precipitation vs. potential evaporation, indicating that precipitation and potential evaporation are independent. We combine a Budyko-type expression, the Turc–Pike equation, with Bouchet's complementary relationship to derive upper and lower Bouchet–Budyko curves, which display a complementary relationship between “apparent” potential evaporation and actual evaporation. The observed warm-season data follow the trend of the Bouchet–Budyko curves. Our study shows the consistency between Budyko's framework and Bouchet's complementary relationship, with the distinction between potential evaporation and “apparent” potential evaporation. The formulated complementary relationship can be used in quantitative modeling practices.},

Over land, the partitioning of precipitation (P) into evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) is the key process to assess hydrological conditions. For climatological averages, the Budyko framework provides a simple first order relationship to estimate the evaporative index E / P as a function of the aridity index (Ep / P, with Ep denoting potential evaporation). However, a major downside of the Budyko framework is its limitation to steady state conditions, being a result of the assumption of a closed land water balance. Nonstationary processes coming into play at other than mean annual catchment scales are thus not represented. Here we propose an analytically derived new formulation of the Budyko curve including an additional parameter being implicitly related to the nonlinear storage term of the land water balance. The new framework is comprehensively analysed, showing that the additional parameter leads to an upward rotation of the original supply limit and therefore implicitly represents the amount of additional water available for evaporation. The obtained model is further validated using standard datasets of P, E and Ep. It is shown that the model is capable to represent first-order seasonal dynamics within the hydroclimatological system.},

The aridity index is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation, representing the dry conditions in Budyko framework. Other factors are the influence of everything else except the aridity index, and are represented by the parameter w in Budyko-type equations, which is a time-dependent variable in this case. Then, the impacts of aridity index and other factors were decomposed based on the annual variations in the Budyko spaces. The results show the current Budyko-type equations, which use time-varying parameters, can improve the fitting capability for most catchments in the United States.

A new formulation physically based (noted ML) is proposed to extend the Budyko framework under non-steady state conditions taking into account the change in soil water storage S. The ML formulation introduces an additional parameter S* = S / Ep and can be applied with all classical Budyko functions. In the standard Budyko space (Ep / P, E / P), and for the particular case where the Fu-Zhang equation is used as a Budyko function, the ML formulation yields similar results to the analytical solution of Greve et al. (2016), and a simple relationship can be established between their respective parameters. Then, the ML formulation is extended to the space [(Ep / (P + S), E / (P + S)] and compared to the formulations of Chen et al. (2013) and Du et al. (2016). We show that the ML and Greve et al. formulations have similar upper feasible domain but their lower feasible domain is different from those of Chen et al. (2103) and Du et al. (2016). Moreover, the domain of variation of Ep / (P + S) differs: it is bounded by an upper limit 1 / S* in the ML formulation, while it is bounded with a lower limit in Chen et al.'s and Du et al.'s formulations.},

In this paper, the development of the Budyko framework is analysed first. The temporal and spatial variability for the Budyko hypothesis are subsequently elaborated. On finer temporal scales, more processes need to be considered, and the degree of control exerted by individual factors on the water balance varies with the spatial scale considered. Finally, perspectives regarding better understanding and application of the Budyko framework at the catchment scale are provided. A representative and diverse catchment data set is required to estimate the parameter in the model. The co-evolution of landscape characteristics and climate properties would be beneficial to improve the Budyko framework with respect to model parsimony and the physical background. It is necessary to illuminate how the empirical Budyko curve would change under climate change. The general laws for selecting variables and statistical methods for improving Budyko models still need to be explored.},

	abstract = {Budyko’s treatment of the long-term water balance of watersheds was based on the competition between water availability and energy supply. It assumes, in the long-term, that precipitation is the only source of water availability for evapotranspiration while the changes in soil water storage are negligible. For arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables, however, groundwater also can supply crop water demand in addition to irrigation and precipitation. In this study, we present a new Budyko formula considering seasonal groundwater uptake and soil water storage changes estimated by Aver’yanov’s equation and abcd model, respectively. The use of groundwater depths rather than the variation of groundwater levels makes it more reasonable to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption. For the application of the Budyko equation in unsteady state areas, equivalent precipitation was designed to take the place of precipitation as water availability. With the newly defined water availability, the relationship between evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index was described successfully by Budyko curves, otherwise the points exceeded Budyko domain with only precipitation and irrigation considered. Furthermore, for agricultural irrigation areas, the variation of seasonal ω is supposed to be affected by vegetation coverage (denoted by NDVI). Overall, it is possible to estimate regional actual seasonal and annual evapotranspiration for irrigation areas with shallow groundwater using the extended Budyko models. This new method can play significant role in water management in arid and semiarid agricultural regions.},

More importantly, use of leaf area index as a direct and indirect indicator of the above ground biomass and plant root system, respectively, reveals the vital role of vegetation in regulating soil moisture storage and hence streamflow intra‐annual variability under different climate conditions.

	abstract = {Partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff is controlled by climate and catchment characteristics. The degree of control exerted by these factors varies with the spatial and temporal scales of processes modeled. The Budyko framework or the “limits” concept was used to model water balance at four temporal scales (mean annual, annual, monthly and daily). The method represents a top-down approach to hydrologic modeling and is expected to achieve parsimony of model parameters. Daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow from 265 catchments in Australia were used. On a mean annual basis, the index of dryness defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation was confirmed to be a dominant factor in determining the water balance with one model parameter. Analysis of the data, however, suggested increased model complexity is necessary on finer time scale such as monthly. In response, the Budyko framework for mean annual water balance was extended to include additional factors and this resulted in a parsimonious lumped conceptual model on shorter-time scale. The model was calibrated and tested against measured streamflow at variable time scales and showed promising results. The strengths of the model are consistent water balance relationships across different time scales, and model parsimony and robustness. As result, the model has the potential to be used to predict streamflow for ungauged catchments.},

Here we extend the framework by introducing a method to specify probabilistic estimates of water availability that account for the nonlinearity of the underlying phase space. The new framework allows to evaluate the predictability of water availability that is related to varying catchment characteristics and conditional on the underlying climatic conditions.

	abstract = {Increased surface temperatures are expected to cause less precipitation in the form of snow. The impact of decreased snowfall has previously been assumed to not influence streamflow significantly. This work applies a water-balance framework to catchments in the United States and finds a greater percentage of precipitation as snowfall is associated with greater mean streamflow. In a warming climate, precipitation is less likely to occur as snowfall1,2. A shift from a snow- towards a rain-dominated regime is currently assumed not to influence the mean streamflow significantly1,3,4,5. Contradicting the current paradigm, we argue that mean streamflow is likely to reduce for catchments that experience significant reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow. With more than one-sixth of the Earth’s population depending on meltwater for their water supply3 and ecosystems that can be sensitive to streamflow alterations6, the socio-economic consequences of a reduction in streamflow can be substantial. By applying the Budyko water balance framework7 to catchments located throughout the contiguous United States we demonstrate that a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow is associated with higher mean streamflow, compared to catchments with marginal or no snowfall. Furthermore, we show that the fraction of each year’s precipitation falling as snowfall has a significant influence on the annual streamflow within individual catchments. This study is limited to introducing these observations; process-based understanding at the catchment scale is not yet provided. Given the importance of streamflow for society, further studies are required to respond to the consequences of a temperature-induced precipitation shift from snow to rain.},

	abstract = {At present, many conceptual water balance models have been proposed on monthly, annual, and mean annual timescales. With the increasing applications of these models, an emerging question is whether the water balance models on different timescales have some commonalities and can be integrated. To this end, this study established and applied a practical unified framework of water balance models that can be applied to different timescales. The framework was first developed on monthly timescale, where the water balance was captured by combining the “abcd” model and Budyko hypothesis with four parameters. Then, this framework was extended to annual and mean annual timescales under which certain parameters can be eliminated or assumed to be certain values. To be specific, on the annual timescale, the water balance was simulated by a Budyko-type model incorporating the water storage change; on the mean annual timescale the water balance was further simplified into a Budyko-type model which neglects the water storage change. Thus, all of the three typical water balance models on different timescales were unified to a general framework. The models were applied to 437 catchments in the contiguous United States with satisfying results achieved. Considering the water storage changes can improve the performance of annual water balance models in regions with clear interannual carrying water storage. Furthermore, the water balance models on different timescales share common supply and demand limits which is similar to Budyko hypothesis.},

The aim of this study is to provide a review of the extended equations and to discuss about using the Budyko framework in a changing world.

Within the Budyko framework, we develop an equation to quantify the relationship between snow ratio and annual runoff from a water–energy balance viewpoint. Based on the proposed equation, attribution of runoff change during the past several decades and possible runoff change induced by projected snow ratio change using climate experiment outputs archived in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analyzed. Results indicate that annual runoff in northwestern mountainous and northern high-latitude areas are sensitive to snow ratio change. The proposed model is applicable to other catchments easily and quantitatively for analyzing the effects of possible change in snow ratio on available water resources and evaluating the vulnerability of catchments to climate change.},

The relative importance of these factors depends on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions. Results from over 250 catchments worldwide show that for a given forest cover, there is a good relationship between long‐term average evapotranspiration and rainfall. From these observations and on the basis of previous theoretical work a simple two‐parameter model was developed that relates mean annual evapotranspiration to rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and plant‐available water capacity. The mean absolute error between modeled and measured evapotranspiration was 42 mm or 6.0\%; the least squares line through the origin had as lope of 1.00 and a correlation coefficient of 0.96. The model showed potential for a variety of applications including water yield modeling and recharge estimation.

	abstract = {An increase in climate change has been leading to non-stationarity in hydrological variables. Therefore, a simple framework within the Budyko hypothesis is proposed to estimate the annual runoff frequency distribution and provide a new method for practical application in hydrological design under the non-stationarity. In this framework, the annual runoff statistic parameters, mean value (MAR) and standard deviation (STD), are derived by the Choudhury-Yang equation; at the same time, a magnification factor γ 1  = 1.358 is introduced to correct the underestimation of the Budyko-based estimated STD according to observation data in 291 catchments across China. Furthermore, the P-Ш type frequency curve is selected to calculate the annual runoff on a specific design return period. Here, the impacts of non-stationarity caused by climate change was considered to be encoded in the changes in statistic parameters and frequency distribution. Based on this framework, the changes in water resources in 207 three-level basins across China during 2020–2050 are given. The results show that the average MAR will decrease by 2.7\% for all basins, and the spatial distribution of MAR will be more even, i.e., it will increase in the north of China and decrease in the south of China. However, the inter-annual variability of annual runoff (shown as STD and variance coefficient, Cv ) will increase in more than 70\% of basins. Additionally, in the dry year, about 65\% of basins show decreased runoff change, which indicates a larger reservoir capacity is need for water resource allocation. These findings offer a simple and effective way to re-examine the effects of non-stationarity on projected annual runoff.},

While direct runoff is the quick response stemming from surface and shallow subsurface flow paths and is often associated with floods, baseflow represents the groundwater contribution from stored sources (e.g., groundwater) to streams and is crucial for environmental flow regulations, and water supply, among others. L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) proposed a two‐step water balance partitioning, where precipitation is divided into direct runoff and catchment wetting, followed by the disaggregation of the latter into baseflow and evapotranspiration. Here, we investigate the role of the aridity index (ratio between mean‐annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation) in controlling the long‐term (mean‐annual) fluxes of direct runoff and baseflow. We present an analytical solution beginning with similar assumptions as proposed by Budyko (1974, https://www.elsevier.com/books/climate-and-life/budyko/978-0-12-139450-9), leading to two complementary expressions for the two fluxes. The aridity index explained 77\% and 89\% of variability in direct runoff and baseflow from 378 catchments within the continental United States, while our formulations were able to reproduce the patterns of water balance partitioning proposed by L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) at the mean‐annual timescale. Our approach can be used to further understand how climate and landscape controls the terrestrial water balance at mean‐annual timescales, while also representing a step toward the prediction of baseflow and direct runoff at ungauged basins. Mean‐annual baseflow and direct runoff, estimated using a low‐pass filter, are controlled to first order by the aridity index The dependence of both fluxes on the aridity index is parameterized considering their limits when aridity index approaches 0 The proposed formulations can reproduce water balance partitioning of the L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) framework at the mean‐annual timescale},

	abstract = {Accurately estimating large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) rates is essential to understanding and predicting global change. Evapotranspiration models that are applied at a continental scale typically operate on relatively large spatial grids, with the result that the heterogeneity in land surface properties and processes at smaller spatial scales cannot be explicitly represented. Averaging over this spatial heterogeneity may lead to biased estimates of energy and water fluxes. Here we estimate how averaging over spatial heterogeneity in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) may affect grid-cell-averaged evapotranspiration rates, as seen from the atmosphere over heterogeneous landscapes across the globe. Our goal is to identify where, under what conditions, and at what scales this “heterogeneity bias” could be most important but not to quantify its absolute magnitude. We use Budyko curves as simple functions that relate ET to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Because the relationships driving ET are nonlinear, averaging over subgrid heterogeneity in P and PET will lead to biased estimates of average ET. We examine the global distribution of this bias, its scale dependence, and its sensitivity to variations in P vs. PET. Our analysis shows that this heterogeneity bias is more pronounced in mountainous terrain, in landscapes where spatial variations in P and PET are inversely correlated, and in regions with temperate climates and dry summers. We also show that this heterogeneity bias increases on average, and expands over larger areas, as the grid cell size increases.},

It has been shown that the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to precipitation (referred as the index of dryness) can be used to estimate mean annual evapotranspiration by using one additional parameter. This study evaluates the effects of climatic and catchment characteristics on the partitioning of mean annual precipitation into evapotranspiration using a rational function approach, which was developed based on phenomenological considerations. Over 470 catchments worldwide with long-term records of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff were considered, and results show that model estimates of mean annual evapotranspiration agree well with observed evapotranspiration taken as the difference between precipitation and runoff. The mean absolute error between modeled and observed evapotranspiration was 54 mm, and the model was able to explain 89\% of the variance with a slope of 1.00 through the origin. This indicates that the index of dryness is the most significant variable in determining mean annual evapotranspiration. Results also suggest that forested catchments tend to show higher evapotranspiration than grassed catchments and their evapotranspiration ratio (evapotranspiration divided by precipitation) is most sensitive to changes in catchment characteristics for regions with the index of dryness around 1.0. Additionally, a stepwise regression analysis was performed for over 270 Australian catchments where detailed information of vegetation cover, precipitation characteristics, catchment slopes, and plant available water capacity was available. It is shown that apart from the index of dryness, average storm depth, plant available water capacity, and storm arrival rate are also significant.},

	abstract = {Effect of climate change and catchment change on the long‐term water balance is of considerable interest at a range of spatial scales. The total differential of runoff within the Budyko framework, which has been widely used to attribute the change in runoff to the effect of climate and catchment changes, is not precise in which there is always some residual between the observed and estimated change in runoff. The objective of this study is to propose and evaluate a new partition method based on the Budyko complementary relationship for runoff. Algebraic identities have ensured that the change in runoff can be decomposed into two components precisely without any residuals using this complementary method. In addition, the complementary method allows estimation of the upper and lower bounds of the climate effect and catchment effect. The new method was compared with the total differential method and an extrapolation method for 15 catchments in Australia. Results show that the average range of the catchment effect using the complementary method was 6.7 mm for 14 of the 15 catchments, which is much smaller than that estimated with the total differential method (51.5 mm). The average of the upper and lower bounds was shown to be in good agreement with the effect of climate and catchment changes estimated using the extrapolation method (R2 = 0.98 for both). Correlation analysis indicates that the average of these bounds is the best estimate of the magnitude of the climate and catchment effect for the 15 catchments examined. Climate and catchment effect on the change in the mean annual runoff can be partitioned precisely using a complementary method The complementary method is better than the total differential method in estimating the catchment effect Average of the upper and lower bounds of the catchment effect is in good agreement with the results using the extrapolation method},

However, no studies have paid attention to the error due to the first-order approximation. This study therefore estimates this error to improve the theoretical framework for assessing the contribution of climate change to runoff based on the Budyko hypothesis. Specifically, the error increases when precipitation (P) decreases and potential evaporation (E0) increases, and n increases. Therefore, an increasing P or decreasing E0 leads to an underestimate of the climatic contributions, while a decreasing P or increasing E0 leads to an overestimate. In addition, we suggest a new method to accurately estimate the contribution of climate change to runoff.},

	abstract = {We use the Budyko framework to calculate catchment-scale evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) as a function of two climatic factors, precipitation (P) and evaporative demand (Eo = 0.75 times the pan evaporation rate), and a third parameter that encodes the catchment properties (n) and modifies how P is partitioned between E and Q. This simple theory accurately predicted the long-term evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) for the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in southeast Australia. We extend the theory by developing a simple and novel analytical expression for the effects on E and Q of small perturbations in P, Eo, and n. The theory predicts that a 10\% change in P, with all else constant, would result in a 26\% change in Q in the MDB. Future climate scenarios (2070–2099) derived using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 climate model output highlight the diversity of projections for P (±30\%) with a correspondingly large range in projections for Q (±80\%) in the MDB. We conclude with a qualitative description about the impact of changes in catchment properties on water availability and focus on the interaction between vegetation change, increasing atmospheric [CO2], and fire frequency. We conclude that the modern version of the Budyko framework is a useful tool for making simple and transparent estimates of changes in water availability.},

We subsequently calculated long-term bias correction factors for three state-of-the-art {\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} climatologies [the “WorldClim version 2” database (WorldClim V2); Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth’s Land Surface Areas, version 1.2 (CHELSA V1.2 ); and Climate Hazards Group Precipitation Climatology, version 1 (CHPclim V1)], after which we used random-forest regression to produce global gap-free bias correction maps for the {\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} climatologies. Monthly climatological bias correction factors were calculated by disaggregating the long-term bias correction factors on the basis of gauge catch efficiencies. We found that all three climatologies systematically underestimate {\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} over parts of all major mountain ranges globally, despite the explicit consideration of orography in the production of each climatology. In addition, all climatologies underestimate {\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} at latitudes \&gt;60°N, likely because of gauge undercatch. Exceptionally high long-term correction factors (\&gt;1.5) were obtained for all three {\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} climatologies in Alaska, High Mountain Asia, and Chile—regions characterized by marked elevation gradients, sparse gauge networks, and significant snowfall.

	abstract = {Available energy (often expressed in terms of potential evaporation) and precipitation largely determine annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates in a region. The ratio of annual potential evaporation to precipitation, referred to as the aridity index by Budyko, has been shown to describe the evaporation ratio (the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to precipitation) of catchments from a range of climatic regimes in a number of studies. It has been shown that aridity index alone can be used to obtain an estimate of ratio of standard deviation of annual evapotranspiration estimates to that of precipitation (the evaporation deviation ratio). At present, there are at least five functional forms available, which describe evaporation ratio as a function of aridity index. This study assesses data from Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma) third-generation atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) against these five functional forms. Evaporation ratio and evaporation deviation ratios from an AGCM simulation are compared against these five functional forms and it is shown that the primary control of available energy and precipitation over annual partitioning of precipitation, and interannual variability of evapotranspiration, is preserved well in the AGCM. The aridity index is further used to obtain an analytic equation, which can be used to estimate change in runoff given annual changes in precipitation and available energy. This equation is validated using data from control and climate change simulations of the CCCma coupled GCM (CGCM1) and shown to perform fairly well. The correlation between CGCM1 simulated annual change in runoff and the values obtained using aridity index is consistently around 0.95, and the average bias varies between 40.5 and 50.3mm/year, for the five functional forms. The successful validation of this equation against data from a GCM climate change simulation illustrates the continued relevance of aridity index, and the primary control of precipitation and available energy in determining annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates.},

Nevertheless, glaciers are one of the most important components of the high-mountain cryosphere in the region as they strongly influence water availability in the arid, continental and intensely populated downstream areas. This study provides reliable and continuous surface mass balance series for selected glaciers located in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay. By cross-validating the results of three independent methods, we reconstructed the mass balance of the three benchmark glaciers, Abramov, Golubin and Glacier no. 354 for the past 2 decades. By applying different approaches, it was possible to compensate for the limitations and shortcomings of each individual method. This study proposes the use of transient snow line observations throughout the melt season obtained from satellite optical imagery and terrestrial automatic cameras. By combining modelling with remotely acquired information on summer snow depletion, it was possible to infer glacier mass changes for unmeasured years. The model is initialized with daily temperature and precipitation data collected at automatic weather stations in the vicinity of the glacier or with adjusted data from climate reanalysis products. Multi-annual mass changes based on high-resolution digital elevation models and in situ glaciological surveys were used to validate the results for the investigated glaciers. Substantial surface mass loss was confirmed for the three studied glaciers by all three methods, ranging from −0.30 ± 0.19 to −0.41 ± 0.33 m w.e. yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$ over the 2004–2016 period. Our results indicate that integration of snow line observations into mass balance modelling significantly narrows the uncertainty ranges of the estimates. Hence, this highlights the potential of the methodology for application to unmonitored glaciers at larger scales for which no direct measurements are available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Patch degradation of the alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) induced by climate warming and anthropogenic activities affects the pattern of coupled water and heat cycling between the land surface and the atmosphere, which could positively feedback to the regional and global climate warming. However, previous research has mostly focused on the homogeneous underlying surface rather than heterogeneous underlying surface. Thus, this study aims at forming a better understanding of the difference in water and heat exchange over heterogeneous underlying surface in the permafrost region of the TP hinterland. We based our analysis on two years of weather and energy flux measurements that were collected over two contrasting landscapes under the same climate conditions: a natural alpine meadow (AM) and severely degraded alpine meadow, termed bare land (BL). The major surface characteristics affecting the difference between AM and BL energy budgets are also presented and analyzed (such as land surface albedo and temperature, shallow soil temperature and moisture, soil stratification, and phenology). The results show that the thawing of a shallow active soil layer induced a rapid increase in soil moisture, triggering the dramatic change in main energy partitioning from sensible heat flux (H) to latent heat flux (LE) in both AM and BL sites. Surface albedo decreased but surface cooling increased with the reduction in the vegetation coverage, and temperature gradient between surface and 10cm depth increased with the erosion of root turf that is capable of thermal insulation and high water retention, together could alter the surface energy budget. The annual surface heat source or available energy (Rn−G) in AM was approximately equal to that in BL. However, more available energy was consumed by H to warm the low atmosphere in BL as evidenced by the Bowen ratio increasing from 0.49 to 0.84 in summer and from 2.96 to 5.64 over a whole year. The results of this research suggest that the soil moisture, canopy, and root turf were the major factors affecting the energy partitioning in the hinterland of the TP. The decrease in vegetation coverage results in increases of H and heating of the lower atmosphere. Therefore, this could lead to a potential positive feedback to regional climate warming. In addition, given the background of TP warming, Kobresia turf can effectively prevent permafrost degradation due to its thermal insulation characteristics.},

This paper employs the threshold temperature method in combination with multi-source dataset (APHRODITE, CPC and meteorological stations) analysis to determine snowfall proportions in precipitation in the Tienshan Mountains, Central Asia, during 1960–2017. The results indicated that temperature-induced precipitation shifting from snow to rain. The S/P experienced an overall declining trend, increasing at a rate of 0.6\%/decade prior to the mid-1990s, followed by a downward trend at a rate of −0.5\%/decade. The S/P decreased mainly at low and middle altitudes (between 1500 and 3500 m). At higher altitudes (over 3500 m), the magnitudes of the decreased S/P ratios were small or even increased due to the temperature always being below freezing. Decreases in S/P are always associated with decreases in annual streamflow in the glacier/snow melt recharged rivers.},

This study employed four Budyko-based methods, namely the total differential method, complementary method, extrapolation method, and decomposition method, to attribute the changes in actual evapotranspiration in 13 basins in China’s Loess Plateau. We compared their performances and analysed factors that contribute to the differences in attribution results yielded by the various methods. The results showed that the total differential, complementary, and decomposition methods presented similar estimates of the contributions of climate change and human activities. However, the extrapolation method showed a large deviation in the contribution of human activities. The error of the extrapolation method was the largest, followed by that of the two-stage total differential method. The complementary method and decomposition method exhibited negligible errors.},

	abstract = {Runoff estimation in ungauged catchments is probably one of the most basic and oldest tasks of hydrologists. This long-standing issue has received increased attention recently due to the PUB (Prediction in Ungauged Basins) initiative. Given the challenges of predicting runoff for ungauged catchments one might argue that the best course of action is to take a few runoff measurements. In this study we explored how implementing such a procedure might support predictions in an ungauged basin. We used a number of monitored Swedish catchments as hypothetical ungauged basins where we pretended to start with no runoff data and then added different sub-sets of the available data to constrain a simple catchment model. These sub-sets consisted of a limited number of single runoff measurements; in other words these data represent what could be measured with limited efforts in an ungauged basin. We used a Monte Carlo approach and predicted runoff as a weighted ensemble mean of simulations using acceptable parameter sets. We found that the ensemble prediction clearly outperformed the predictions using single parameter sets and that surprisingly little runoff data was necessary to identify model parameterizations that provided good results for the “ungauged” test periods. These results indicated that a few runoff measurements can contain much of the information content of continuous runoff time series. However, the study also indicated that results may differ signiﬁcantly between catchments and also depend on the days chosen for taking the measurements.},

Teaching hydrological modeling, however, is challenging, since students have to both understand general model concepts and be able to use particular computer programs when learning to apply computer models. Here we present a new version of the HBV (Hydrologiska Byra˚ns Vattenavdelning) model. This software provides a user-friendly version that is especially useful for education. Different functionalities, such as an automatic calibration using a genetic algorithm or a Monte Carlo approach, as well as the possibility to perform batch runs with predeﬁned model parameters make the software interesting especially for teaching in more advanced classes and research projects. Different teaching goals related to hydrological modeling are discussed and a series of exercises is suggested to reach these goals.},

The methodology is based on an indirect comparison of snow water equivalent simulated by the hydrologic model and the MODIS snow cover data. The analysis is performed for 148 catchments in Austria using the original Terra and Aqua MODIS images as well as MODIS snow cover products based on the combination of Terra and Aqua and on different spatial and temporal ﬁlters that reduce cloud coverage by using information from neighbouring non-cloud covered pixels in space or time. The results indicate that the use of the MODIS snow cover data improves the snow model performance as measured against independent ground snow depth data. In a veriﬁcation mode, the median snow cover overestimation error of 7.1\% of mismatch decreases to 5.6\% and the corresponding underestimation error decreases from 4.7 to 4.1\% if the combined MODIS data are used for calibration as compared to the case where no MODIS data are used. MODIS snow cover data also slightly improve the runoff model performance. In a veriﬁcation mode, the median runoff model efﬁciency increases from 0.67 to 0.70 if MODIS data are used for calibration as compared to the case where no MODIS data are used. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the magnitude of the model efﬁciency is sensitive to the choice of the threshold of snow covered area used in estimating the snow underestimation errors, and the cloud cover threshold used in deciding whether a MODIS image can be used for model analysis. Evaluation of the model performance against merged MODIS snow products shows that the combination and ﬁltering of the Aqua and Terra images does not signiﬁcantly affect the runoff and snow model efﬁciency.},

Such contributions can be estimated via hydrological models, provided that the modeling adequately accounts for snow and glacier melt, as well as rainfall runoff. We present a multiple data set calibration approach to estimate runoff composition using hydrological models with three levels of complexity. For this purpose, the code of the conceptual runoff model HBV-light was enhanced to allow calibration and validation of simulations against glacier mass balances, satellite-derived snow cover area and measured discharge. Three levels of complexity of the model were applied to glacierized catchments in Switzerland, ranging from 39 to 103 km2. The results indicate that all three observational data sets are reproduced adequately by the model, allowing an accurate estimation of the runoff composition in the three mountain streams. However, calibration against only runoff leads to unrealistic snow and glacier melt rates. Based on these results, we recommend using all three observational data sets in order to constrain model parameters and compute snow, glacier, and rain contributions. Finally, based on the comparison of model performance of different complexities, we postulate that the availability and use of different data sets to calibrate hydrological models might be more important than model complexity to achieve realistic estimations of runoff composition.},

The new version, HBV-96, uses subbasin division with a typical resolution of 40 km 2, although any resolution can be used. In addition, each subbasin is divided into elevation bands, vegetation and snow classes. Automatic weighting of precipitation and temperature stations was introduced and a new automatic calibration scheme was developed. The modifications led to significant improvements in model performance. In seven test basins the average value of the efficiency criterion R z increased from 86 to 89\%, with improvements in both the calibration and verification periods. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

On the basis of a theoretically founded modelling protocol, the different steps in distributed hydrological modelling are illustrated through a case study based on the MIKE SHE code and the 440 km2 Karup catchment in Denmark. The importance of a rigorous and purposeful parameterisation is emphasized in order to get as few ‘‘free’’ parameters as possible for which assessments through calibration are required. Calibration and validation using a split-sample procedure were carried out for catchment discharge and piezometric heads at seven selected observation wells. The validated model was then used for two further validation tests. Firstly, model simulations were compared with observations from three additional discharge sites and four additional wells located within the catchment. This internal validation showed signiﬁcantly poorer results compared to the calibration/validation sites. Secondly, the validated model based on a 500 m model grid was used to generate three additional models with 1000 m, 2000 m and 4000 m grids through interpolation of model parameters. The results from the multi-scale validation suggested that a maximum grid size of 1000 m should be used for simulations of discharge and ground-water heads, while the results deteriorated with coarser model grids.},

This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale’, ‘observation scale’ and ‘modelling (working) scale’ require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that upscaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptualizations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking conceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

	abstract = {A terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modelling process, its interaction with the broader water management process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modelling processes. Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment and characterisation: data uncertainty engine (DUE), error propagation equations, expert elicitation, extended peer review, inverse modelling (parameter estimation), inverse modelling (predictive uncertainty), Monte Carlo analysis, multiple model simulation, NUSAP, quality assurance, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, stakeholder involvement and uncertainty matrix. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modelling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed. It is concluded that uncertainty assessment is not just something to be added after the completion of the modelling work. Instead uncertainty should be seen as a red thread throughout the modelling study starting from the very beginning, where the identiﬁcation and characterisation of all uncertainty sources should be performed jointly by the modeller, the water manager and the stakeholders.

They provide realizations of plausible but as yet unobserved streamﬂow time series with the same temporal and distributional characteristics as the observed data. However, the representation of non-stationarities and spatial dependence among sites remains a challenge in stochastic modeling. We investigate whether the use of frequency-domain instead of time-domain models allows for the joint simulation of realistic, continuous streamﬂow time series at daily resolution and spatial extremes at multiple sites. To do so, we propose the stochastic simulation approach called Phase Randomization Simulation using wavelets (PRSim.wave) which combines an empirical spatio-temporal model based on the wavelet transform and phase randomization with the ﬂexible four-parameter kappa distribution. The approach consists of ﬁve steps: (1) derivation of random phases, (2) ﬁtting of the kappa distribution, (3) wavelet transform, (4) inverse wavelet transform, and (5) transformation to kappa distribution. We apply and evaluate PRSim.wave on a large set of 671 catchments in the contiguous United States. We show that this approach allows for the generation of realistic time series at multiple sites exhibiting short- and long-range dependence, non-stationarities, and unobserved extreme events. Our evaluation results strongly suggest that the ﬂexible, continuous simulation approach is potentially valuable for a diverse range of water management applications where the reproduction of spatial dependencies is of interest. Examples include the development of regional water management plans, the estimation of regional ﬂood or drought risk, or the estimation of regional hydropower potential.},

water transported through the landscape to recipient surface waters is
critical in many hydrological and biogeochemical investigations. In this
study, a particle-tracking model approach in Mike SHE was used to investigate the pathway and its associated travel time of water in 14 partly
nested, long-term monitored boreal sub-catchments of the Krycklan catchment
(0.12–68 km2). This region is characterized by long and snow-rich winters with little groundwater recharge and highly dynamic runoff during spring snowmelt. The geometric mean of the annual travel time distribution
(MTTgeo) for the studied sub-catchments varied from 0.8 to 2.7 years. The variations were related to the different landscape types and their varying
hydrological responses during different seasons. Winter MTTgeo ranged from 1.2 to 7.7 years, while spring MTTgeo varied from 0.5 to 1.9 years. The modelled variation in annual and seasonal MTTgeo and the fraction of
young water ({\textless}3 months) was supported by extensive observations of
both δ18O and base cation concentrations in the different
streams. The travel time of water to streams was positively correlated with the area coverage of low-conductive silty sediments (r=0.90, P{\textless}0.0001). Catchments with mixed soil–landscape settings typically displayed larger variability in seasonal MTTgeo, as contrasting hydrological
responses between different soil types (e.g. peat in mires, till and silty
sediments) are integrated. The areal coverage of mires was especially
important for the young water contribution in spring (r=0.96, P{\textless}0.0001). The main factor for this was attributed to extensive soil frost in
mires, causing considerable overland flow during the snowmelt period.
However, this lower groundwater recharge during snowmelt caused
mire-dominated catchments to have longer stream runoff MTTgeo than
comparable forest catchments in winter. Boreal landscapes are sensitive to
climate change, and our results suggest that changes in seasonality are
likely to cause contrasting responses in different catchments depending on
the dominating landscape type.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Recent advances in soil moisture remote sensing have
produced satellite data sets with improved soil moisture mapping under
vegetation and with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study,
we evaluate the potential of a new, experimental version of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil water index data set for multiple objective calibrations of a conceptual hydrologic model. The analysis is performed in 213 catchments in Austria for the period 2000–2014. An HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning)-type hydrologic model is calibrated based on runoff
data, ASCAT soil moisture data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data for various
calibration variants. Results show that the inclusion of soil moisture data
in the calibration mainly improves the soil moisture simulations, the
inclusion of snow data mainly improves the snow simulations, and the inclusion of both of them improves both soil moisture and snow simulations to almost the same extent. The snow data are more efficient at improving snow simulations than the soil moisture data are at improving soil moisture simulations. The improvements of both runoff and soil moisture model efficiencies are larger in low elevation and agricultural catchments than in others. The calibrated snow-related parameters are strongly affected by including snow data and, to a lesser extent, by soil moisture data. In contrast, the soil-related parameters are only affected by the inclusion of soil moisture data. The results indicate that the use of multiple remote sensing products in hydrological modeling can improve the representation of hydrological fluxes and prediction of runoff hydrographs at the catchment scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Knowledge of current snow cover extent is
essential for characterizing energy and moisture fluxes at the Earth's
surface. The snow-covered area (SCA) is often estimated by using optical
satellite information in combination with the normalized-difference snow
index (NDSI). The NDSI thereby uses a threshold for the definition if a
satellite pixel is assumed to be snow covered or snow free. The
spatiotemporal representativeness of the standard threshold of 0.4 is
however questionable at the local scale. Here, we use local snow cover maps
derived from ground-based photography to continuously calibrate the NDSI
threshold values (NDSIthr) of Landsat satellite images at two
European mountain sites of the period from 2010 to 2015. The
Research Catchment Zugspitzplatt (RCZ, Germany) and Vernagtferner area
(VF, Austria) are both located within a single Landsat scene. Nevertheless, the
long-term analysis of the NDSIthr demonstrated that the
NDSIthr at these sites are not correlated (r = 0.17) and different
than the standard threshold of 0.4. For further comparison, a dynamic and locally
optimized NDSI threshold was used as well as another locally optimized
literature threshold value (0.7). It was shown that large uncertainties in
the prediction of the SCA of up to 24.1 \% exist in satellite snow cover
maps in cases where the standard threshold of 0.4 is used, but a newly
developed calibrated quadratic polynomial model which accounts for
seasonal threshold dynamics can reduce this error. The model minimizes the
SCA uncertainties at the calibration site VF by 50 \% in the evaluation
period and was also able to improve the results at RCZ in a significant way.
Additionally, a scaling experiment shows that the positive effect of a locally adapted
threshold diminishes using a pixel size of 500 m or larger,
underlining the general applicability of the standard threshold at larger scales.},

The new MODIS products (i.e. Collection 6) provide information about the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) instead of simple binary information about snow cover of the former products. The objective of this study is to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of different NDSI thresholds used for snow cover mapping and to compare the results with former snow cover classification based on a fixed NDSI threshold (NDSI = 0.4). The accuracy is tested for both Aqua (MYD10A1) and Terra (MOD10A1) daily snow cover products by using daily snow depth observations at 665 climate stations in Austria in the period 2002–2014. The results show the overall classification accuracy over 665 climate stations to be larger than 97\% (97.4\% for Terra and 97.6\% for Aqua) in Austria. The best NDSI thresholds fitted to individual stations can differ from a fixed threshold (NDSI = 0.4) and are sensitive to the snow depth threshold indicating snow cover at the ground. The NDSI thresholds vary seasonally, decrease with increasing elevation and are lower in forested than open land cover settings. We found that the NDSI thresholds fitted to different elevation and land cover classes improve regional snow cover mapping by 3–10\% in forested regions above 900 m a.s.l. in January to March.},

The continental climate is characterized by hot and dry summer months and cold winter seasons with most precipitation occurring as snowfall. Accordingly, freshwater supply is strongly depending on the amount of accumulated snow as well as the moment of its release after snowmelt. The aim of the presented study is to identify possible changes in snow cover characteristics, consisting of snow cover duration, onset and offset of snow cover season within the last 28 years. Relying on remotely sensed data originating from medium resolution imagers, these snow cover characteristics are extracted on a daily basis. The resolution of 500–1000 m allows for a subsequent analysis of changes on the scale of hydrological sub-catchments. Long-term changes are identified from this unique dataset, revealing an ongoing shift towards earlier snowmelt within the Central Asian Mountains. This shift can be observed in most upstream hydro catchments within Pamir and Tian Shan Mountains and it leads to a potential change of freshwater availability in the downstream regions, exerting additional pressure on the already tensed situation.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that high elevation environments are among very sensitive to climatic changes and where impacts are exacerbated. Across Central Asia, which is especially vulnerable to climate change due to aridity, the ability of global climate projections to capture the complex dynamics of mountainous environments is particularly limited. Over montane Central Asia, agropastoralism constitutes a major portion of the rural economy. Extensive herbaceous vegetation forms the basis of rural economies in Kyrgyzstan. Here we focus on snow cover seasonality and the effects of terrain on phenology in highland pastures using remote sensing data for 2001–2017. First, we describe the thermal regime of growing season using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data, analyzing the modulation by elevation, slope, and aspect. We then characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from modeling the land surface phenology using Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series together with MODIS LST data. Using rank correlations, we then analyzed the influence of four metrics of snow cover seasonality calculated from MODIS snow cover composites—first date of snow, late date of snow, duration of snow season, and the number of snow-covered dates (SCD)—on two key metrics of land surface phenology in the subsequent growing season, specifically, peak height (PH; the maximum modeled NDVI) and thermal time to peak (TTP; the amount of growing degree-days accumulated during modeled green-up phase). We evaluated the role of terrain features in shaping the relationships between snow cover metrics and land surface phenology metrics using exact multinomial tests of equivalence. Key findings include (1) a positive relationship between SCD and PH occurred in over 1664 km2 at p {\textless} 0.01 and 5793 km2 at p {\textless} 0.05, which account for {\textgreater}8\% of 68,881 km2 of the pasturelands analyzed in Kyrgyzstan; (2) more negative than positive correlations were found between snow cover onset and PH, and more positive correlations were observed between snowmelt timing and PH, indicating that a longer snow season can positively influence PH; (3) significant negative correlations between TTP and SCD appeared in 1840 km2 at p {\textless} 0.01 and 6208 km2 at p {\textless} 0.05, and a comparable but smaller area showed negative correlations between TTP and last date of snow (1538 km2 at p {\textless} 0.01 and 5188 km2 at p {\textless} 0.05), indicating that under changing climatic conditions toward earlier spring warming, decreased duration of snow cover may lead to lower pasture productivity, thereby threatening the sustainability of montane agropastoralism; and (4) terrain had a stronger influence on the timing of last date of snow cover than on the number of snow-covered dates, with slope being more important than aspect, and the strongest effect appearing from the interaction of aspect and steeper slopes. In this study, we characterized the snow-phenology interactions in highland pastures and revealed strong dependencies of pasture phenology on timing of snowmelt and the number of snow-covered dates.},

Three mosaics (M1976, M2001 and M2013) with minimal cloud and snow cover were constructed, and the uncertainty due to each epoch having a finite span was accounted for. Glacier outlines (TPG1976, TPG2001 and TPG2013) were digitized manually with guidance from the SRTM DEM v4.1 and Google Earth imagery. To achieve complete multi-temporal coverage in a reasonable time, only debris-free ice was delineated. Area mapping uncertainty was evaluated at three study sites, Mount Qomolangma (Everest), Mount Naimona’Nyi, Mount Geladandong, where the largest differences between present and earlier measurements were within ∼±4\%. Area differences with previous inventories ranged from −19.6\% (TPG1976 minus the first Chinese Glacier Inventory) to −3.6\% and −1.1\% (TPG2013 and TPG2001, respectively minus the second Chinese Glacier Inventory), while the difference TPG2001 minus the GAMDAM Glacier Inventory was +10.4\%.

	abstract = {Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30–40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas.},

We use a combination of human and physical geography approaches to understand the meltwater-controlled hydrology of the system (using hydrochemical mixing models) as well as the human-water experience (via community surveys). Surveys indicate that current water stress is primarily a function of water management and access issues resulting from the clunky transition from Soviet era large-scale agriculture to post-Soviet small-plot farming. Snow and ice meltwaters play a dominant role in the surface and ground water supplies to downstream communities across the study’s 4220 m elevation gradient, so future increases to water stress due to changes in volume and timing of water supply is likely given frozen waters’ high sensitivities to warming temperatures. The combined influence of social, political and climate-induced pressures on water supplies in the Naryn basin suggest the need for proactive planning and adaptation strategies, and warrant concern for similar melt-sourced Central Asian watersheds.},

The goal of this paper is to distinguish the specific contribution of seasonal snow versus glacier ice melt in the major basins of High Mountain Asia: Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya. Our methodology involves the application of MODIS-derived remote sensing products to separately calculate daily melt outputs from snow and glacier ice. Using an automated partitioning method, we generate daily maps of (1) snow over glacier ice, (2) exposed glacier ice, and (3) snow over land. These are inputs to a temperature index model that yields melt water volumes contributing to river flow. Results for the five major High Mountain Asia basins show that the western regions are heavily reliant on snow and ice melt sources for summer dry season flow when demand is at a peak, whereas monsoon rainfall dominates runoff during the summer period in the east. While uncertainty remains in the temperature index model applied here, our approach to partitioning melt from seasonal snow and glacier ice is both innovative and systematic and more constrained than previous efforts with similar goals.},

	abstract = {A new snow reanalysis method is presented that is designed to jointly assimilate Landsat- and MODIS-derived (MODSCAG) fractional snow covered area (fSCA) to characterize seasonal snow in remote regions like High Mountain Asia (HMA) where in situ data is severely lacking. The method leverages existing readily available global datasets for forcing a snow model and uses the fSCA retrievals along with the ensemble prior model estimates to derive posterior estimates using a Bayesian framework. The method addresses MODIS viewing-geometry effects on the fSCA retrievals by accounting for viewing angle dependent measurement errors and using a CDF-matching technique to improve the joint fSCA measurement consistency before assimilation. The method was veriﬁed through comparison with the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates over the Tuolumne River watershed in California. The posterior SWE estimates were shown to be much more consistent with the independent ASO estimates across the three WYs examined. Tests over Tuolumne showed that in cases where sufﬁcient Landsat observations are available (i.e., with multiple sensors and in areas of overlapping Landsat tiles), assimilation of only Landsat data may be optimal, which is attributable primarily to the higher spatial resolution of the raw Landsat data, but that in cases with fewer Landsat measurements (i.e., with single Landsat tiles and/or signiﬁcant reduction due to clouds), the additional screened and CDF-matched MODIS-based measurements can have a positive (albeit marginal) impact. Illustrative results are presented for nine HMA test tiles to illustrate how the method can provide posterior estimates of the space-time climatology of SWE storage in areas where in situ data does not generally exist. Ongoing work is being conducted to use the method outlined herein to generate an HMA-wide reanalysis dataset that will provide an opportunity for a more thorough characterization of HMA seasonal snow storage and dynamics over the joint Landsat-MODIS era. The method is generalizable to any midlatitude montane region where seasonal snow is important.},

The importance of assessing past and future climate diﬀerences plays an important role in future planning in relation to climate change. The spatiotemporal variability of erosivity depending on precipitation using the rainfall erosivity (R) of Universal Soil Loss Equation under the global circulation model (GCM) scenarios in the Chirchik–Akhangaran Basin (CHAB), which is in the northeastern part of the Republic of Uzbekistan, was statistically downscaled by using the delta method in Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 during the periods of the 2030s, 2050s and 2070s. The (R) was used to determine the erosivity of precipitation, and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) itself determined the eﬀects of changes in erosivity. Ten weather station observational data points for the period from 1990 to 2016 were used to validate the global circulation models (GCMs) and erosion model. The assessment results showed an increase in precipitation from the baseline by an average of 11.8\%, 14.1\% and 16.3\% for all models by 2030, 2050 and 2070, respectively, while at the same time, soil loss increased in parallel with precipitation by 17.1\%, 20.5 \% and 23.3\%, respectively, in certain scenarios. The highest rainfall was observed for the models ACCESS1–3 and CanESM2 on both RCPs and periods, while more intense rainfall was the main reason for the increase in the spatial and temporal erosion activity of the rainfall-runoﬀ. This study is a useful reference for improving soil conservation, preventing water erosion and ensuring the future sustainability of agricultural products, as well as improving the operational management and planning of agriculture.},

However, the observation network in Central Asia is poor to carry out such studies in detail. Observations from space using remote sensing techniques might fill this observation gap, which needs to be validated. Therefore, this study evaluates the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover product in Central Asia. For the evaluation, in situ snow depth data from 30 meteorological stations and higher resolution Landsat data are used. The results show an overall snow agreement between MODIS and ground observations of 93.1 and 92.7\% for MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua snow products, respectively. The agreement between MODIS and Landsat is 91.9\% when considering snow and land agreements. The snow fraction product from MODIS is also validated using Landsat data, and varying accuracies are obtained. The main disadvantage of the MODIS snow cover product are the cloud induced gaps. Therefore, cloud covered pixels are eliminated using the ModSnow algorithm. Using the in situ data, the snow agreement of cloud removed snow cover data is checked, and an accuracy of 84.4\% is achieved.},

The SWE data from the ERA-40 and SD from the JRA-25 reanalyses demonstrated good agreement with the measured data in the plain part of the Aral Sea Basin in the terms of the mean values (1979–2000) and the correlation coefficients. For the mountain part of the basin, however, the agreement was less consistent, and all the reanalyses tended to underestimate the SWE and SD. The interannual variability of the snow cover area (SCA) from satellite data in the Aral Sea Basin (1971–2006) was also analyzed. The biggest fluctuations of the SCA were observed between 1971 and 1982, and between 1995 and 2005, and the lowest ones during 1983 through 1993. The analysis of the long-term variability of the SD revealed a positive trend during the period from 1930 through 1965 in the upper and middle reaches of the Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers. After 1965, a tendency towards a decrease of the SD in the southern part of the Aral Sea Basin was identified. The analysis of the long-term trends of the SD and the river runoffs in the Amudarya and Syrdarya basins showed that the runoffs of Amudarya and, especially, Syrdarya rivers were increasing, while the SD was mostly decreasing. The SCA in the Aral Sea Basin also exhibited a statistically significant decreasing trend.},

The analysis included comparisons of mean basin values and correlation of anomalies, as well as seasonal and interannual variabilities and trends. ERA-40 generally provided better estimates of mean SWE values for river basins than did the NCEP–DOE reanalysis. Mean SD values from the JRA-25 reanalysis were systematically underestimated. The best correlations among the anomalies were given by ERA-40, followed by JRA-25. All reanalyses reproduced seasonal variability well, although the differences in absolute values varied substantially. The highest differences were typically connected with the snowmelt period (April and May). Interannual variability confirmed the errors of ERA-40 and JRA-25 in 1992–94 and 1979–83, respectively. Otherwise, the reproduction of the interannual variability of SWE and SD was reasonable. Strong biases in SD data from JRA-25 that decrease with time induce artificial positive trends. Significant underestimations of SWE data by ERA-40 for 1991–94 influenced the values of the trends. NCEP–DOE reasonably represented the trend found in measured data. In general, the highest discrepancies between measured and reanalysis data were found for the northern European and eastern Asian rivers (Pechora, Lena, and Amur). The assessment of the quality of SWE and SD reanalysis data can help potential users in the selection of a particular reanalysis as being appropriate to the purpose of their studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Under clear sky in both products, the agreement of land classification from MODIS Terra and Aqua daily and 8-day snow cover products is close to 100\% for a entire water year. In contrast, the agreement of snow classification from MODIS Terra and Aqua is high only in the winter months, decreasing in the rest of the period. The high agreement mainly concentrates in land or snow-dominated areas, and major disagreements take place in the transitions zones from snow to land. The disagreement (mainly snow–land) in the 8-day products is higher than that in the daily products. In addition, both MODIS Terra and Aqua cloud masks tend to map more areas in the transition zones as cloud. Under clear sky conditions, the three daily products have similar accuracy of snow and land classification, and the 8-day standard products and the multi-day combination product also have similar accuracy of snow and land classification. This further suggests that the algorithm in the combination of Terra and Aqua snow cover products is valid. Moreover, in the actual weather/cloud conditions, the combination products from Terra and Aqua reduce cloud blockage and improve snow classification accuracy against either MODIS Terra or Aqua (51\% against 44\% and 34\% for daily and 92\% against 87\% and 78\% for 8-day, respectively), although Terra snow product (daily or 8-day) has slightly better accuracy than the Aqua snow product. The new combination products can provide better mapping of spatiotemporal variation of snow cover/glacier and for snow-melting modeling. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This is why this study focuses on estimating the pixel cover for cloud covered areas where no information is available. Our step to this product involves employing methodology based on six successive steps that estimate the pixel cover using different temporal and spatial information. The study was carried out for the Kokcha River basin located in northeastern part of Afghanistan. Snow coverage in catchments, like Kokcha, is very important where the melt-water from snow dominates the river discharge in vegetation period for irrigation purposes. Since no snow related observations were available from the region, the performance of the proposed methodology was tested using the cloud generated MODIS snow cover data as possible “ground truth” information. The results show successful performances arising from the methods applied, which resulted in all cloud coverage being removed. A validation was carried out for all subsequent steps, to be outlined below, where each step removes progressively more cloud coverage. Steps 2 to 5 (step 1 was not validated) performed very well with an average accuracy of between 90–96\%, when applied one after another for the selected valid days in this study. The sixth step was the least accurate at 78\%, but it led to the removal of all remaining cloud cover.},

During the summer months the snow-melt- and glacier-melt-dominated river discharge originating in the mountains provides the main water resource available for agricultural production, but also for storage in reservoirs for energy generation during the winter months. Thus a reliable seasonal forecast of the water resources is crucial for sustainable management and planning of water resources. In fact, seasonal forecasts are mandatory tasks of all national hydro-meteorological services in the region. In order to support the operational seasonal forecast procedures of hydro-meteorological services, this study aims to develop a generic tool for deriving statistical forecast models of seasonal river discharge based solely on observational records. The generic model structure is kept as simple as possible in order to be driven by meteorological and hydrological data readily available at the hydro-meteorological services, and to be applicable for all catchments in the region. As snow melt dominates summer runoff, the main meteorological predictors for the forecast models are monthly values of winter precipitation and temperature, satellite-based snow cover data, and antecedent discharge. This basic predictor set was further extended by multi-monthly means of the individual predictors, as well as composites of the predictors. Forecast models are derived based on these predictors as linear combinations of up to four predictors. A user-selectable number of the best models is extracted automatically by the developed model fitting algorithm, which includes a test for robustness by a leave-one-out cross-validation. Based on the cross-validation the predictive uncertainty was quantified for every prediction model. Forecasts of the mean seasonal discharge of the period April to September are derived every month from January until June. The application of the model for several catchments in Central Asia – ranging from small to the largest rivers (240 to 290\&thinsp;000\&thinsp;km{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} catchment area) – for the period 2000–2015 provided skilful forecasts for most catchments already in January, with adjusted {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} values of the best model in the range of 0.6–0.8 for most of the catchments.

The later forecasts in May and June improve further due to the high predictive power of the discharge in the first 2 months of the snow melt period. The improved skill of the set of forecast models with decreasing lead time resulted in narrow predictive uncertainty bands at the beginning of the snow melt period. In summary, the proposed generic automatic forecast model development tool provides robust predictions for seasonal water availability in Central Asia, which{\textless}span id="page2226"/{\textgreater} will be tested against the official forecasts in the upcoming years, with the vision of operational implementation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Spatially distributed snow cover information is important for the assessment of climate-related variability of water resources and for calibration and validation of hydrological models in snow-dominated regions. Near-real-time snow cover data can be valuable for short term to seasonal streamflow prediction. Such information can be extracted using remote sensing techniques with good accuracy. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data, meanwhile available for more than 15 years, have been shown to be useful for monitoring snow cover extent in remote areas. This data can be processed and used with only 2-day delay, which is sufficient for many water resources management purposes. However, processing remote sensing data require knowledge and computational skills to handle large amounts of data. Moreover, cloud obscuration in optical remote sensing such as MODIS may lead to data gaps. These limitations impede the use of the freely available MODIS data for water resources management in developing countries, particularly in snow-dominated mountainous regions. To overcome this, we present the all-in-one software package MODSNOW-Tool. It processes raw MODIS data and eliminates cloud cover using advanced cloud removal algorithms. The ready-to-use output of the MODSNOW-Tool is a cloud-free snow cover map and a daily report, which includes spatiotemporal snow statistics for pre-defined river basins. The accuracy of cloud-eliminated MODSNOW snow cover maps was validated for 84 almost cloud-free days in the Karadarya river basin in Central Asia, and an average accuracy of 94 \% was achieved. The MODSNOW-Tool can be used in operational and non-operational mode. In the operational mode, the tool is set up as a scheduled task on a local computer allowing automatic execution without user interaction and delivers snow cover maps on a daily basis. In the non-operational mode, the tool can be used to process historical time series of snow cover maps from MODIS.},

	abstract = {In alpine and high-latitude regions, water resource decision making often requires large-scale estimates of snow amounts and melt rates. Such estimates are available through distributed snow models which in some situations can be improved by assimilation of remote sensing observations. However, in regions with frequent cloud cover, complex topography, or large snow amounts satellite observations may feature information of limited quality. In this study, we examine whether assimilation of snow water equivalent (SWE) data from ground observations can improve model simulations in a region largely lacking reliable remote sensing observations. We combine the model output with the point data using three-dimensional sequential data assimilation methods, the ensemble Kalman filter, and statistical interpolation. The filter performance was assessed by comparing the simulation results against observed SWE and snow-covered fraction. We find that a method which assimilates fluxes (snowfall and melt rates computed from SWE) showed higher model performance than a control simulation not utilizing the filter algorithms. However, an alternative approach for updating the model results using the SWE data directly did not show a significantly higher performance than the control simulation. The results show that three-dimensional data assimilation methods can be useful for transferring information from point snow observations to the distributed snow model.},

	abstract = {In high mountainous catchments, the spatial precipitation and therefore the overall water balance is generally difﬁcult to estimate. The present paper describes the structure and calibration of a semi-lumped conceptual glaciohydrological model for the joint simulation of daily discharge and annual glacier mass balance that represents a better integrator of the water balance. The model has been developed for climate change impact studies and has therefore a parsimonious structure; it requires three input times series – precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration – and has 7 parameters to calibrate. A multi-signal approach considering daily discharge and – if available – annual glacier mass balance has been developed for the calibration of these parameters. The model has been calibrated for three different catchments in the Swiss Alps having glaciation rates between 37\% and 52\%. It simulates well the observed daily discharge, the hydrological regime and some basic glaciological features, such as the annual mass balance.},

We calibrate and validate a semi-distributed conceptual catchment model for two 11-year periods in 320 Austrian catchments and test three approaches of parameter calibration: (a) traditional single objective calibration (SINGLE) on daily runoff; (b) multiple objective calibration (MULTI) using daily runoff and snow cover data; (c) multiple objective calibration (APRIORI) that incorporates an a priori expert guess about the parameter distribution as additional information to runoff and snow cover data. Results indicate that the MULTI approach performs slightly poorer than the SINGLE approach in terms of runoff simulations, but significantly better in terms of snow cover simulations. The APRIORI approach is essentially as good as the SINGLE approach in terms of runoff simulations but is slightly poorer than the MULTI approach in terms of snow cover simulations. An analysis of the parameter uncertainty indicates that the MULTI approach significantly decreases the uncertainty of the model parameters related to snow processes but does not decrease the uncertainty of other model parameters as compared to the SINGLE case. The APRIORI approach tends to decrease the uncertainty of all model parameters as compared to the SINGLE case. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	title = {Regionalisation of catchment model parameters},
	abstract = {We simulate the water balance dynamics of 308 catchments in Austria using a lumped conceptual model involving 11 calibration parameters. We calibrate and verify the model for two non-overlapping 11-year periods of daily runoff data. A comparison of the calibrated parameter values of the two periods suggests that all parameters are associated with some uncertainty although the degree of uncertainty differs between the parameters. The regional patterns of the calibrated parameters can be interpreted based on hydrological process reasoning indicating that they are able to represent the regional or large-scale differences in the hydrological conditions. Catchment attributes explain some of the spatial parameter variability with coefﬁcients of determination of up to R2 ¼ 0:27; but usually the R2 values are lower. Parameter uncertainty does not seem to cloud the relationship between calibrated parameters and catchment attributes to a signiﬁcant extent as suggested by an optimised correlation analysis. The median Nash –Sutcliffe efﬁciencies of simulating streamﬂow decrease from 0.67 to 0.63 when moving from the calibration to the veriﬁcation period. This is a small decrease, which suggests that problems with overparameterisation of the model are unlikely. We then compare regionalisation methods for estimating the model parameters in ungauged catchments, in terms of the model performance. The best regionalisation methods are the use of the average parameters of immediate upstream and downstream (nested) neighbours and regionalisation by kriging. For the calibration period, the average decrease in the Nash– Sutcliffe model efﬁciency, as a result of the regionalisation, is 0.10 which is about twice the decrease of moving from the calibration to the veriﬁcation period. The methods based on multiple regressions with catchment attributes perform signiﬁcantly poorer. Apparently, spatial proximity is a better surrogate of unknown controls on runoff dynamics than catchment attributes.},

The results indicate that the agreement between the two top soil moisture estimates changes with the season and the weight given to the scatterometer in hydrologic model calibration. The hydrologic model generally simulates larger top soil moisture values than are observed by the scatterometer. The differences tend to be smaller for lower altitudes and the winter season. The average correlation between the two estimates is more than 0.5 in the period from July to October, and about 0.2 in the winter months, depending on the period and calibration setting. Using both ERS scatterometer based soil moisture and runoff for model calibration provides more robust model parameters than using either of these two sources of information.},

The riparian countries of these rivers have experienced recurring water allocation conflicts ever since the Soviet Union col- lapsed. Will climate change exacerbate water stress and thus conflicts? We have developed a coupled climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya to quantify impacts and show that climatic changes are likely to have consequences on runoff seasonality due to earlier snow-melt. This will increase water stress in unregulated catchments because less water will be available for irrigation in the summer months. Threats from geohazards, above all glacier lake outbursts, are likely to increase as well. The area at highest risk is the densely populated, agricultur- ally productive, and politically unstable Fergana Valley. Targeted infrastructural developments will be required in the region. If the current mismanagement of water and energy resources can be replaced with more effective resource allocation mechanisms through the strengthening of transboundary institutions, Central Asia will be able to successfully address these future climate-related challenges.},

General (G) and detailed (D) simulations were developed based on assessment of the Tien Shan glacier recession between 1943 and 2003 using an iterative stepwise increase in the equilibrium line altitude of 20 m. The G simulation was developed for 2777 grids each of which covered over 1000 km2 of glacier surface and D for the 15 953 Tien Shan glaciers. Both simulations employed glacier morphometric characteristics derived from Digital Elevation Model based on remote sensing data, high resolution maps and in situ GPS validation. Simulated changes in glacier area demonstrated that a possible increase in air temperature of 1 ◦C at E¯ LA must be compensated by a 100 mm increase in precipitation at the same altitude if Tien Shan glaciers are to be maintained in their current state. An increase in mean air temperature of 4 ◦C and precipitation of 1.1 times the current level could increase E¯ LA by 570 m during the 21st century. Under these conditions, the number of glaciers, glacier covered area, glacier volume, and glacier runoff are predicted to be 94\%, 69\%, 75\%, and 75\% of current values. The maximum glacier runoff may reach as much as 1.25 times current levels while the minimum will likely equal zero.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian approach to estimate bias and uncertainty in snowfall precipitation from MERRA-2 and other precipitation products was applied over High Mountain Asia (HMA), using a newly developed snow reanalysis method. Starting from an “uninformed” prior probability distribution, a posterior scaling factor applied to MERRA2 snowfall was derived by constraining model-based estimates of seasonal snow accumulation and ablation over the water year (WY) with fractional snow covered area (fSCA) measurements derived from Landsat and MODIS (MODSCAG). Several subdomains (nine representative 1◦ by 1◦ tiles) across HMA were examined over the period WYs 2001–2015 and compiled into an uncertainty parameterization where a lognormal distribution was ﬁtted to the empirical posterior distribution with a mean of 1.54 (median of 1.19) and coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of 0.83, indicating that MERRA-2 underestimates snowfall on average by ∼54\% with sizeable uncertainty. For reference, the uncertainties in snowfall precipitation from the ERA5 and APHRODITE2 precipitation products were also evaluated, and these products were found to underestimate snowfall, on average by a factor around 1.78 and 3.34 (with median scaling factors of 1.42 and 2.51), respectively. The results indicate that snowfall precipitation at high-elevations dominated by snowfall is underestimated in most existing products, especially in the gauge-based APHRODITE-2 product, where the biases were also found to exhibit geographical variations with the largest underestimation in monsoon-inﬂuenced high-elevation tiles. The derived MERRA-2 uncertainty model is being used to develop a full domain-wide HMA snow reanalysis, which will shed further light onto the space-time variations in snowfall biases in these products.},

Data S1.  S1 consists of a file structure where each RGI region (excluding Antarctica) has a subdirectory containing 9 files (05Greenland contains 7 files) in the format .shp. The naming convention of each file begins with the RGI region number and name, e.g. “01Alaska”, followed by a shorthand name as defined below:   1.    “\_minGl1km2.shp” An amended RGI v6.0 where glaciers with a surface area less than 1 km2 are removed, area identified as false positive is removed and areas identified as false negative is added. These errors were manually identified by one individual (Sam Herreid) for all regions on Earth.  The attribute table of this file include unaltered RGI v6.0 fields [3, 4]:  [RGIId], [GLIMSId], [RGIFlag], [01Region], [02Region], [Zmin], [Zmax], [Zmed], [Slope], [Aspect], [Lmax], [GlacType] and [Name]. New fields calculated with the amended geometries are: [totGl\_km2] = Total glacier area within this region (km2) [totDeb\_km2] = Total debris-covered area within this region (km2) [spatDo\_km2] = Total area of the spatial domain considered for this region in this study (km2) [perc\_deb] = Region-wide percent debris-covered area: [totDeb\_km2]/[spatDo\_km2] [FP\_km2] = Total RGI v6.0 false positive area within this region (km2) [FN\_km2] = Total RGI v6.0 false negative area within this region (km2) [FP\_perc] = Region-wide percent false positive area: [FP\_km2]/[spatDo\_km2] [FN\_perc] = Region-wide percent false negative area: [FP\_km2]/[spatDo\_km2] [regionFrac] = Fraction of altered regional total area considered, i.e. 1-[regionFrac] is glacier area meeting the criteria: glacier area {\textgreater}1 km2, but falls outside of the satellite image composite (Fig. S1): [spatDo\_km2]/[totGl\_km2] [RGI6consid] = Fraction of the total, unaltered RGI v6.0 area (including glaciers smaller than 1 km2) considered in this study: [spatDo\_km2]/raw RGI v6.0 area (calculated using the projections listed in Table S1)  2.    “\_minGl1km2\_debrisCover.shp” Debris-cover map accompanying the above glacier area (1.)  where glaciers smaller than 1 km2 are removed. The attribute field [img\_time] gives the decimal year, time of satellite image acquisition, that was the source data to derive each debris cover shape. Due to the source imagery being a composite dataset, there are image seams present within some debris shapes to preserve accurate map dating.       3.    “\_minGl2km2.shp” An amended RGI v6.0, identical to 1. above, but where glaciers with a surface area less than 2 km2 are removed.  The attribute table of this file include unaltered RGI v6.0 fields [3, 4]:  [RGIId], [GLIMSId], [RGIFlag], [01Region], [02Region], [Area], [Zmin], [Zmax], [Zmed], [Slope], [Aspect], [Lmax], [GlacType] and [Name]. New fields calculated with the amended geometries for each glacier are: [FloDivErro] = Flow divide error flags a glacier by assigning a value of 1 if the calculation [deb\_km2]/[abl\_km2] is greater than 1. This can occur, for example, if a glacier shape has two ablation zones defined (per the definition used here, one glacier can only have one ablation zone). Because the code anticipates only one value for ablation zone area it does not sum the area of several shapes and thus the total debris area can be greater than one ablation zone area alone. To identify remaining glaciers with two or more ablation zones (indicative of a flow divide error), the centroid of each ablation zone area was found. Where two or more centroids fell within one glacier shape (accounting for centroids that might fall within a nunatak void), [FloDivErro] was assigned a value of 2. For both [FloDivErro] = 1 and [FloDivErro] = 2, the remaining metrices were set to the null value of ‘-9999’ and the potential flow divide error was not assessed or corrected. [CenLon] = Centroid longitude, recalculated with appended glacier geometry.  [CenLat] = Centroid latitude, recalculated with appended glacier geometry. [gl\_km2] = Glacier area (km2) calculated with appended glacier geometry. [gl\_km2\_nan] = Glacier area (km2) calculated with appended glacier geometry. Glaciers where the criteria was not met for the metrics with the most strict criteria (stage, moraine abundance, future debris expansion and AAR) are assigned a NaN (not a number) value of ‘-9999’.  [deb\_km2] = Debris-covered area (km2) calculated with appended glacier geometry. [abl\_km2] = Ablation zone area (km2) calculated with appended glacier geometry. [abl\_prim\_m] = Raw ablation zone perimeter (m). [abl\_primSm] = Simplified ablation zone perimeter (m), filtered to reduce variability in glacier outline complexity due to the variable methods used to generate outlines within the RGI 6.0.  [deb\_prim\_m] = Debris cover perimeter (m). [eq\_line\_m] = Equilibrium line length (m). [exPotLen\_m] = Length of the debris cover perimeter that is composed of the boundary between bare glacier ice and supraglacial debris cover.  [aar] = the AAR (accumulation zone area ratio). [stage] = Debris cover stage metric. Glaciers that did not meet the criteria for this metric (see above) are assigned a NaN value of ‘-9999’. [debExPot] = Debris expansion potential metric. Glaciers where no debris cover was mapped are assigned a NaN value of ‘-9999’. [futExPot] = Future expansion potential metric. Glaciers that did not meet the criteria for this metric (see above) are assigned a NaN value of ‘-9999’. [percDeb] = Percent debris-covered. [percDebNaN] = Percent debris-covered. Glaciers where the criteria was not met for the metrics with the most strict criteria (stage, moraine abundance, future debris expansion and AAR) are assigned a NaN (not a number) value of ‘-9999’.  [moraineAbu] = Moraine abundance metric. Glaciers that did not meet the criteria for this metric (see above) are assigned a NaN value of ‘-9999’. 4.    “\_minGl2km2\_debrisCover.shp” Debris-cover map accompanying the above glacier area (2.) where glaciers smaller than 2 km2 are removed.  5.    “\_ablationZone.shp” Estimated ablation zone area after smoothing and simplifying filters. Attribute table field [abl\_perim] is the ablation zone perimeter length (m) for each glacier meeting the debris cover percentage and debris-covered area criteria described above.   6.    “\_equilibriumLine.shp” Estimated equilibrium line for each glacier that met the criteria for defining an ablation zone.  7.    “\_debrisExpansionLine.shp” The boundary between supraglacial debris and bare glacier ice.  8.    “\_RGI60\_fp.shp” Area within the Randolph Glacier Inventory version 6.0 that was manually identified as false positive relative to the Landsat imagery used in this study.  9.    “\_RGI60\_fn.shp” Glacier area that was visually determined to be neglected from the Randolph Glacier Inventory version 6.0 and manually digitized from the Landsat imagery used in this study. Data S2. S2 consists of 15 shapefiles, one for each RGI region where: RGI regions 01 and 02 are combined; RGI regions 13, 14 and 15 are combined; and RGI region 19 (Antarctic and subantarctic) is excluded. Each shapefile contains the Landsat image footprints that have been pieced together to form an overlap-free image composite from which debris cover was mapped in this study. Attribute field [img\_time] gives the decimal year of image acquisition for each satellite image and [Landsat\_ID] gives the NASA assigned ID. Data S3. S3 contains the results from a debris cover map comparison analysis with [1] on a global scale and [2] for High Mountain Asia. For the comparison with [1], each file begins with the RGI region number and name, e.g. “01Alaska”, followed by a shorthand name as defined below:   1.    “\_Scherler2018\_fp” False positive area in the results from [1] (Landsat ratio product: LS\_DC\_2013\_2017\_RATIO) over only the spatial domain where there was data coverage in this study and where "DC\_CTSmean {\textgreater}= 10" from [1]. This term is imperfectly named because instances where [1] is correct and this study is wrong should not be classified as a ‘false positive’ difference.  2.    “\_Scherler2018\_fn” False negative area in the results from [1] (Landsat ratio product: LS\_DC\_2013\_2017\_RATIO) over only the spatial domain where there was data coverage in this study and where "DC\_CTSmean {\textgreater}= 10" from [1]. This term is imperfectly named because instances where [1] is correct and this study is wrong should not be classified as a ‘false negative’ difference.  3.    “\_Scherler2018\_tp” Area where the debris cover map from this study and [1] agree.  For the comparison with [2], each file begins with “13\_14\_15HMA” followed by a shorthand name as defined below:   4.    “\_Kraaijenbrink2017\_fp” False positive area in the debris maps from [2] over the spatial domain where there was data coverage in this study.

Despite their potential importance, the climatological characteristics of these joint events have received little attention regardless of growing interest in climate change impacts on compound events. Here, we ask how event timescale relates to (1) spatial patterns of compound hot–dry events in the United States, (2) the spatial extent of compound hot–dry events, and (3) the importance of temperature and precipitation as drivers of compound events. To study such rare spatial and multivariate events, we introduce a multi-site multi-variable weather generator (PRSim.weather), which enables generation of a large number of spatial multivariate hot–dry events. We show that the stochastic model realistically simulates distributional and temporal autocorrelation characteristics of temperature and precipitation at single sites, dependencies between the two variables, spatial correlation patterns, and spatial heat and meteorological drought indicators and their co-occurrence probabilities. The results of our compound event analysis demonstrate that (1) the northwestern and southeastern United States are most susceptible to compound hot–dry events independent of timescale, and susceptibility decreases with increasing timescale; (2) the spatial extent and timescale of compound events are strongly related to sub-seasonal events (1–3 months) showing the largest spatial extents; and (3) the importance of temperature and precipitation as drivers of compound events varies with timescale, with temperature being most important at short and precipitation at seasonal timescales. We conclude that timescale is an important factor to be considered in compound event assessments and suggest that climate change impact assessments should consider several timescales instead of a single timescale when looking at future changes in compound event characteristics. The largest future changes may be expected for short compound events because of their strong relation to temperature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Glacier length is an important measure of glacier geometry. Nevertheless, global glacier inventories are mostly lacking length data. Only recently semi-automated approaches to measure glacier length have been developed and applied regionally. Here we present a ﬁrst global assessment of glacier length using an automated method that relies on glacier surface slope, distance to the glacier margins and a set of trade-off functions. The method is developed for East Greenland, evaluated for East Greenland as well as for Alaska and eventually applied to all ∼ 200 000 glaciers around the globe. The evaluation highlights accurately calculated glacier length where digital elevation model (DEM) quality is high (East Greenland) and limited accuracy on lowquality DEMs (parts of Alaska). Measured length of very small glaciers is subject to a certain level of ambiguity. The global calculation shows that only about 1.5 \% of all glaciers are longer than 10 km, with Bering Glacier (Alaska/Canada) being the longest glacier in the world at a length of 196 km. Based on the output of our algorithm we derive global and regional area–length scaling laws. Differences among regional scaling parameters appear to be related to characteristics of topography and glacier mass balance. The present study adds glacier length as a key parameter to global glacier inventories. Global and regional scaling laws might prove beneﬁcial in conceptual glacier models.},

The model uses temperature data extrapolated from nearby climate stations, and is tuned by varying precipitation to make the model fit the observed distribution of mass balance with altitude. Once the model is tuned, the effect of temperature change is simulated by recalculating the mass balance with the same parameters as before, but with a temperature increase of 1°C throughout the year. The largest mass-balance changes, involving increased ablation of {\textgreater} 1 m w.e. a−1 °C−1, occur at the snout, with a progressively smaller increase with altitude. The area-averaged sensitivities for the five glaciers are −0.7 to −0.9 m w.e. a−1 °C−1. If annual precipitation also increased by 20\% it would partly offset the effect of the 1°C higher temperatures but could not compensate for it.},

During the last few decades, a large variety of melt models have been developed, ranging from simple temperature-index to sophisticated energy-balance models. There is a recent trend towards modelling with both high temporal and spatial resolution, the latter accomplished by fully distributed models. This review discusses the relevant processes at the surface-atmosphere interface, and their representation in melt models. Despite considerable advances in distributed melt modelling there is still a need to refine and develop models with high spatial and temporal resolution based on moderate input data requirements. While modelling of incoming radiation in mountain terrain is relatively accurate, modelling of turbulent fluxes and spatial and temporal variability in albedo constitute major uncertainties in current energy-balance melt models, and thus need further research.},

The RGI was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the \$198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 Æ 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about Æ5\%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.},

Projections of future glacier change, estimates of the available freshwater resources or assessments of potential sea-level rise all need glacier ice thickness to be accurately constrained. Previous estimates of global glacier volumes are mostly based on scaling relations between glacier area and volume, and only one study provides global-scale information on the ice thickness distribution of individual glaciers. Here we use an ensemble of up to five models to provide a consensus estimate for the ice thickness distribution of all the about 215,000 glaciers outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The models use prin- ciples of ice flow dynamics to invert for ice thickness from surface characteristics. We find a total volume of 158 ± 41 × 103 km3, which is equivalent to 0.32 ± 0.08 m of sea-level change when the fraction of ice located below present-day sea level (roughly 15\%) is subtracted. Our results indicate that High Mountain Asia hosts about 27\% less glacier ice than previously suggested, and imply that the timing by which the region is expected to lose half of its present-day glacier area has to be moved forward by about one decade.},

	abstract = {High-mountain Asia (HMA) constitutes the largest glacierized region outside of the Earth's polar regions. Although available observations are limited, long-term records indicate sustained HMA glacier mass loss since {\textasciitilde}1850, with accelerated loss in recent decades. Recent satellite data capture the spatial variability of this mass loss, but spatial resolution is coarse and some estimates for regional and HMA-wide mass loss disagree. To address these issues, we generated 5797 high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from available sub-meter commercial stereo imagery (DigitalGlobe WorldView-1/2/3 and GeoEye-1) acquired over HMA glaciers from 2007–2018 (primarily 2013–2017). We also reprocessed 28278 ASTER DEMs over HMA from 2000–2018. We combined these observations to generate robust elevation change trend maps and geodetic mass balance estimates for 99\% of HMA glaciers between 2000 and 2018. We estimate total HMA glacier mass change of -19.0±2.5 Gt yr-1 (-0.19±0.03 m w.e. yr-1). We document the spatial pattern of HMA glacier mass change with unprecedented detail, and present aggregated estimates for HMA glacierized sub-regions and hydrologic basins. Our results offer improved estimates for the HMA contribution to global sea level rise in recent decades with total cumulative sea-level rise contribution of {\textasciitilde}0.7 mm from exorheic basins between 2000 and 2018. We estimate that the range of excess glacier meltwater runoff due to negative glacier mass balance in each basin constitutes {\textasciitilde}12-53\% of the total basin-specific glacier meltwater runoff. These results can be used for calibration and validation of glacier mass balance models, satellite gravimetry observations, and hydrologic models needed for present and future water resource management.},

	abstract = {Glaciers in High Mountain Asia are an important freshwater resource for large populations living downstream who rely on runoff for hydropower, irrigation, and municipal use. Projections of glacier mass change and runoff therefore have important socio-economic impacts. In this study, we use a new dataset of geodetic mass balance observations of almost all glaciers in the region to calibrate the Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) using Bayesian inference. The new dataset enables the model to capture spatial variations in mass balance and the Bayesian inference enables the uncertainty associated with the model parameters to be quantified. Validation with historical mass balance observations shows the model performs well and the uncertainty is well captured. Projections of glacier mass change for 22 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) estimate that by the end of the century glaciers in High Mountain Asia will lose between 3311\% (RCP2.6) and 689\% (RCP8.5) of their total mass relative to 2015. Considerable spatial and temporal variability exists between regions due to the climate forcing and glacier characteristics (hypsometry, ice thickness, elevation range). Projections of annual glacier runoff reveal most monsoon-fed river basins (Ganges, Brahmaputra) will hit a maximum (peak water) prior to 2050, while the Indus and other westerlies-fed river basins will likely hit peak water after 2050 due to significant contributions from excess glacier meltwater. Monsoon-fed watersheds are projected to experience large reductions in end-of-summer glacier runoff. Uncertainties in projections at regional scales are dominated by the uncertainty associated with the climate forcing, while at the individual glacier level, uncertainties associated with model parameters can be significant.},

	abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth’s glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000–2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 ± 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 ± 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 ± 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7–9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

The best predictors of the glacier-wide mass balance are the slope of the glacier tongue and the mean glacier elevation for most regions, with the notable exception of the inner Tibetan Plateau. Glacier-wide mass balances do not differ significantly between debris-free and debris-covered glaciers in 7 of the 12 regions analyzed. Lake-terminating glaciers have more negative mass balances than the regional averages, the influence of lakes being stronger on small glaciers than on large glaciers.},

	abstract = {Large-scale models often use a single grid to represent an entire catchment assuming homogeneity; the impacts of such an assumption on simulating evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow remain poorly understood. Here, we compare hydrological dynamics at Shale Hills (PA, USA) using a complex model (spatially explicit, {\textgreater}500 grids) and a simple model (spatially implicit, two grids using “effective” parameters). We asked two questions: What hydrological dynamics can a simple model reproduce at the catchment scale? What processes does it miss by ignoring spatial details? Results show the simple model can reproduce annual runoff ratios and ET, daily discharge peaks (e.g., storms, floods) but not discharge minima (e.g., droughts) under dry conditions. Neither can it reproduce different streamflow from the two sides of the catchment with distinct land surface characteristics. The similar annual runoff ratios between the two models indicate spatial details are not as important as climate in reproducing annual scale ET and discharge partitioning. Most of the calibrated parameters in the simple model are within the ranges in the complex model, except that effective porosity has to be reduced to 40\% of the average porosity from the complex model. The form of the storage-discharge relationship is similar. The effective porosity in the simple model however represents the dynamic and mobile water storage in the effective drainage area of the complex model that connects to the stream and contributes to high streamflow; it does not represent the passive, immobile water storage in the often disconnected uphill areas. This indicates that an additional uphill functioning unit is needed in the simple model to simulate the full spectrum of high-low streamflow dynamics in natural catchments.},
