	abstract = {Increased surface temperatures are expected to cause less precipitation in the form of snow. The impact of decreased snowfall has previously been assumed to not influence streamflow significantly. This work applies a water-balance framework to catchments in the United States and finds a greater percentage of precipitation as snowfall is associated with greater mean streamflow. In a warming climate, precipitation is less likely to occur as snowfall1,2. A shift from a snow- towards a rain-dominated regime is currently assumed not to influence the mean streamflow significantly1,3,4,5. Contradicting the current paradigm, we argue that mean streamflow is likely to reduce for catchments that experience significant reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow. With more than one-sixth of the Earth’s population depending on meltwater for their water supply3 and ecosystems that can be sensitive to streamflow alterations6, the socio-economic consequences of a reduction in streamflow can be substantial. By applying the Budyko water balance framework7 to catchments located throughout the contiguous United States we demonstrate that a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow is associated with higher mean streamflow, compared to catchments with marginal or no snowfall. Furthermore, we show that the fraction of each year’s precipitation falling as snowfall has a significant influence on the annual streamflow within individual catchments. This study is limited to introducing these observations; process-based understanding at the catchment scale is not yet provided. Given the importance of streamflow for society, further studies are required to respond to the consequences of a temperature-induced precipitation shift from snow to rain.},

Projected data using {GCMs} ({EC}-{EARTH}, {GFDL}-{CM}3, {HadGEM}2-{ES}, {MIROC}5 and {MPI}-{ESM}-{MR}) for the period of 2021–2040 are employed with a 35-year observation period of 1984–2014. For data downscaling the {LARS}-{WG} method on its version 6.0 was used. Identiﬁcation of the lowest error indicates (including {RMSE} and R2) were used to ﬁnd the model with the best ﬁt to projections from the historical period; the {EC}-{EARTH} model was used to show the changes in the basin’s ﬂow to the Sardabrud River in the period 2021–2040. Results from a conceptual glacier-hydrologic model ({GSM}-{SOCONT}) for joint simulation of daily discharges of the glacier are described. Despite a predicted 6\% decrease in precipitation, the results point to an increase of 10\% in ﬂows in the Sardabrud River, meaning there is deﬁnitive evidence of reduction of annual glacier mass due to increasing temperatures and the melting of the glacier, as caused by climate change.},

By 2100, the impact of climate change on the cryosphere and hydrosphere in the Alps is expected to lead to a decrease in annual river discharge. In this work, we modelled the twenty-first century evolution of runoff in the Arve river, downstream of Mont-Blanc’s French side. For the first time for this region, we have forced a hydrological model with output from an ice-dynamical glacier model and 16 downscaled climate projections, under {RCP}4.5 and {RCP}8.5 scenarios. By 2100, under {RCP}8.5 (high-emission scenario), the winter discharge of the Arve river remains low but is expected to increase by 80\% when compared to the beginning of the century. By contrast, the summer season, currently the most important discharge period, will be marked by a runoff decrease of approximately 40\%. These changes are almost similar according to a scenario with a lower warming ({RCP}4.5) and are mostly driven by glacier retreat. These shifts will have significant downstream impacts on water quantity and quality, affecting hydroelectric generation, agriculture, forestry, tourism and aquatic ecosystems.},

During the last few decades, a large variety of melt models have been developed, ranging from simple temperature-index to sophisticated energy-balance models. There is a recent trend towards modelling with both high temporal and spatial resolution, the latter accomplished by fully distributed models. This review discusses the relevant processes at the surface-atmosphere interface, and their representation in melt models. Despite considerable advances in distributed melt modelling there is still a need to refine and develop models with high spatial and temporal resolution based on moderate input data requirements. While modelling of incoming radiation in mountain terrain is relatively accurate, modelling of turbulent fluxes and spatial and temporal variability in albedo constitute major uncertainties in current energy-balance melt models, and thus need further research.},

Runoff scenarios for different climates (doubling of {CO}2) and glacierization conditions predict an increased ﬂood risk as a ﬁrst stage and a more complex picture after a complete glacier loss: a higher discharge during spring due to an earlier and more intense snowmelt is followed by a water deﬁciency in hot and dry summer periods. This unfavourable seasonal redistribution of the water supply has dramatic consequences for the Central Asian lowlands, which depend to a high degree on the glacier melt water for irrigation and already nowadays suffer from water shortages.},

For example, April 1 snow water equivalent ({SWE}) has been an effective index for streamflow forecasting, but it cannot express the effects of midwinter melt events, now expected in warming snow climates, nor can we assume that station-based measurements will be representative of snow conditions in future decades. Remote sensing and climate model data provide capacity for a suite of multi-use snow metrics from local to global scales. Such indicators need to be simple enough to “tell the story” of snowpack changes over space and time, but not overly simplistic or overly complicated in their interpretation. We describe a suite of spatially explicit, multi-temporal snow metrics based on global satellite data from {NASA}'s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) and downscaled climate model output for the U.S. We describe and provide examples for Snow Cover Frequency ({SCF}), Snow Disappearance Date ({SDD}), At-Risk Snow ({ARS}), and Frequency of a Warm Winter ({FWW}). Using these retrospective and prospective snow metrics, we assess the current and future snow-related conditions in three hydroclimatically different U.S. watersheds: the Truckee, Colorado Headwaters, and Upper Connecticut. In the two western U.S. watersheds, {SCF} and {SDD} show greater sensitivity to annual differences in snow cover compared with data from the ground-based Snow Telemetry ({SNO}℡) network. The eastern U.S. watershed does not have a ground-based network of data, so these {MODIS}-derived metrics provide uniquely valuable snow information. The {ARS} and {FWW} metrics show that the Truckee Watershed is highly vulnerable to conversion from snowfall to rainfall ({ARS}) and midwinter melt events ({FWW}) throughout the seasonal snow zone. In comparison, the Colorado Headwaters and Upper Connecticut Watersheds are colder and much less vulnerable through mid- and late-century.},

            Decades of sustainable dam planning efforts have focused on containing dam impacts in regime conditions, when the dam is fully filled and operational, overlooking potential disputes raised by the filling phase. Here, we argue that filling timing and operations can catalyze most of the conflicts associated with a dam’s lifetime, which can be mitigated by adaptive solutions that respond to medium-to-long term hydroclimatic fluctuations. Our retrospective analysis of the contested recent filling of Gibe {III} in the Omo-Turkana basin provides quantitative evidence of the benefits generated by adaptive filling strategies, attaining levels of hydropower production comparable with the historical ones while curtailing the negative impacts to downstream users. Our results can inform a more sustainable filling of the new megadam currently under construction downstream of Gibe {III}, and are generalizable to the almost 500 planned dams worldwide in regions influenced by climate feedbacks, thus representing a significant scope to reduce the societal and environmental impacts of a large number of new hydropower reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Large-scale models often use a single grid to represent an entire catchment assuming homogeneity; the impacts of such an assumption on simulating evapotranspiration ({ET}) and streamflow remain poorly understood. Here, we compare hydrological dynamics at Shale Hills ({PA}, {USA}) using a complex model (spatially explicit, {\textgreater}500 grids) and a simple model (spatially implicit, two grids using “effective” parameters). We asked two questions: What hydrological dynamics can a simple model reproduce at the catchment scale? What processes does it miss by ignoring spatial details? Results show the simple model can reproduce annual runoff ratios and {ET}, daily discharge peaks (e.g., storms, floods) but not discharge minima (e.g., droughts) under dry conditions. Neither can it reproduce different streamflow from the two sides of the catchment with distinct land surface characteristics. The similar annual runoff ratios between the two models indicate spatial details are not as important as climate in reproducing annual scale {ET} and discharge partitioning. Most of the calibrated parameters in the simple model are within the ranges in the complex model, except that effective porosity has to be reduced to 40\% of the average porosity from the complex model. The form of the storage-discharge relationship is similar. The effective porosity in the simple model however represents the dynamic and mobile water storage in the effective drainage area of the complex model that connects to the stream and contributes to high streamflow; it does not represent the passive, immobile water storage in the often disconnected uphill areas. This indicates that an additional uphill functioning unit is needed in the simple model to simulate the full spectrum of high-low streamflow dynamics in natural catchments.},

Glacier-wide mass balances do not differ significantly between debris-free and debris-covered glaciers in 7 of the 12 regions analyzed.

	abstract = {Glaciers in High Mountain Asia are an important freshwater resource for large populations living downstream who rely on runoff for hydropower, irrigation, and municipal use. Projections of glacier mass change and runoff therefore have important socio-economic impacts. In this study, we use a new dataset of geodetic mass balance observations of almost all glaciers in the region to calibrate the Python Glacier Evolution Model ({PyGEM}) using Bayesian inference. The new dataset enables the model to capture spatial variations in mass balance and the Bayesian inference enables the uncertainty associated with the model parameters to be quantified. Validation with historical mass balance observations shows the model performs well and the uncertainty is well captured. Projections of glacier mass change for 22 General Circulation Models ({GCMs}) and four Representative Concentration Pathways ({RCPs}) estimate that by the end of the century glaciers in High Mountain Asia will lose between 3311\% ({RCP}2.6) and 689\% ({RCP}8.5) of their total mass relative to 2015. Considerable spatial and temporal variability exists between regions due to the climate forcing and glacier characteristics (hypsometry, ice thickness, elevation range). Projections of annual glacier runoff reveal most monsoon-fed river basins (Ganges, Brahmaputra) will hit a maximum (peak water) prior to 2050, while the Indus and other westerlies-fed river basins will likely hit peak water after 2050 due to significant contributions from excess glacier meltwater. Monsoon-fed watersheds are projected to experience large reductions in end-of-summer glacier runoff. Uncertainties in projections at regional scales are dominated by the uncertainty associated with the climate forcing, while at the individual glacier level, uncertainties associated with model parameters can be significant.},

	abstract = {High-mountain Asia ({HMA}) constitutes the largest glacierized region outside of the Earth's polar regions. Although available observations are limited, long-term records indicate sustained {HMA} glacier mass loss since {\textasciitilde}1850, with accelerated loss in recent decades. Recent satellite data capture the spatial variability of this mass loss, but spatial resolution is coarse and some estimates for regional and {HMA}-wide mass loss disagree. To address these issues, we generated 5797 high-resolution digital elevation models ({DEMs}) from available sub-meter commercial stereo imagery ({DigitalGlobe} {WorldView}-1/2/3 and {GeoEye}-1) acquired over {HMA} glaciers from 2007–2018 (primarily 2013–2017). We also reprocessed 28278 {ASTER} {DEMs} over {HMA} from 2000–2018. We combined these observations to generate robust elevation change trend maps and geodetic mass balance estimates for 99\% of {HMA} glaciers between 2000 and 2018. We estimate total {HMA} glacier mass change of -19.0±2.5 Gt yr-1 (-0.19±0.03 m w.e. yr-1). We document the spatial pattern of {HMA} glacier mass change with unprecedented detail, and present aggregated estimates for {HMA} glacierized sub-regions and hydrologic basins. Our results offer improved estimates for the {HMA} contribution to global sea level rise in recent decades with total cumulative sea-level rise contribution of {\textasciitilde}0.7 mm from exorheic basins between 2000 and 2018. We estimate that the range of excess glacier meltwater runoff due to negative glacier mass balance in each basin constitutes {\textasciitilde}12-53\% of the total basin-specific glacier meltwater runoff. These results can be used for calibration and validation of glacier mass balance models, satellite gravimetry observations, and hydrologic models needed for present and future water resource management.},

	abstract = {The Randolph Glacier Inventory ({RGI}) is a globally complete collection of digital outlines of glaciers, excluding the ice sheets, developed to meet the needs of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for estimates of past and future mass balance. The {RGI} was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the \$198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 Æ 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about Æ5\%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the {RGI}. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the {RGI} glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The {RGI} has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Glacier length is an important measure of glacier geometry. Nevertheless, global glacier inventories are mostly lacking length data. Only recently semi-automated approaches to measure glacier length have been developed and applied regionally. Here we present a ﬁrst global assessment of glacier length using an automated method that relies on glacier surface slope, distance to the glacier margins and a set of trade-off functions. The method is developed for East Greenland, evaluated for East Greenland as well as for Alaska and eventually applied to all ∼ 200 000 glaciers around the globe. The evaluation highlights accurately calculated glacier length where digital elevation model ({DEM}) quality is high (East Greenland) and limited accuracy on lowquality {DEMs} (parts of Alaska). Measured length of very small glaciers is subject to a certain level of ambiguity. The global calculation shows that only about 1.5 \% of all glaciers are longer than 10 km, with Bering Glacier (Alaska/Canada) being the longest glacier in the world at a length of 196 km. Based on the output of our algorithm we derive global and regional area–length scaling laws. Differences among regional scaling parameters appear to be related to characteristics of topography and glacier mass balance. The present study adds glacier length as a key parameter to global glacier inventories. Global and regional scaling laws might prove beneﬁcial in conceptual glacier models.},

Despite their potential importance, the climatological characteristics of these joint events have received little attention regardless of growing interest in climate change impacts on compound events. Here, we ask how event timescale relates to (1) spatial patterns of compound hot–dry events in the United States, (2) the spatial extent of compound hot–dry events, and (3) the importance of temperature and precipitation as drivers of compound events. To study such rare spatial and multivariate events, we introduce a multi-site multi-variable weather generator ({PRSim}.weather), which enables generation of a large number of spatial multivariate hot–dry events. We show that the stochastic model realistically simulates distributional and temporal autocorrelation characteristics of temperature and precipitation at single sites, dependencies between the two variables, spatial correlation patterns, and spatial heat and meteorological drought indicators and their co-occurrence probabilities. The results of our compound event analysis demonstrate that (1) the northwestern and southeastern United States are most susceptible to compound hot–dry events independent of timescale, and susceptibility decreases with increasing timescale; (2) the spatial extent and timescale of compound events are strongly related to sub-seasonal events (1–3 months) showing the largest spatial extents; and (3) the importance of temperature and precipitation as drivers of compound events varies with timescale, with temperature being most important at short and precipitation at seasonal timescales. We conclude that timescale is an important factor to be considered in compound event assessments and suggest that climate change impact assessments should consider several timescales instead of a single timescale when looking at future changes in compound event characteristics. The largest future changes may be expected for short compound events because of their strong relation to temperature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

High Mountain Asia for 2000–2016, derived by correcting observed glacier thinning patterns
for mass redistribution due to ice flow. We find that 41\% of glaciers accumulated mass over
less than 20\% of their area, and only 60\% ± 10\% of regional annual ablation was compensated by accumulation. Even without 21st century warming, 21\% ± 1\% of ice volume will
be lost by 2100 due to current climatic-geometric imbalance, representing a reduction in
glacier ablation into rivers of 28\% ± 1\%. The ablation of glaciers in the Himalayas and Tien
Shan was mostly unsustainable and ice volume in these regions will reduce by at least 30\%
by 2100. The most important and vulnerable glacier-fed river basins (Amu Darya, Indus, Syr

The attribute field [img\_time] gives the decimal year, time of satellite image acquisition, that was the source data to derive each debris cover shape.

This can occur, for example, if a glacier shape has two ablation zones defined (per the definition used here, one glacier can only have one ablation zone). Because the code anticipates only one value for ablation zone area it does not sum the area of several shapes and thus the total debris area can be greater than one ablation zone area alone. To identify remaining glaciers with two or more ablation zones (indicative of a flow divide error), the centroid of each ablation zone area was found. Where two or more centroids fell within one glacier shape (accounting for centroids that might fall within a nunatak void), [{FloDivErro}] was assigned a value of 2.

Data S2. S2 consists of 15 shapefiles, one for each {RGI} region where: {RGI} regions 01 and 02 are combined; {RGI} regions 13, 14 and 15 are combined; and {RGI} region 19 (Antarctic and subantarctic) is excluded. Each shapefile contains the Landsat image footprints that have been pieced together to form an overlap-free image composite from which debris cover was mapped in this study. Attribute field [img\_time] gives the decimal year of image acquisition for each satellite image and [Landsat\_ID] gives the {NASA} assigned {ID}. Data S3.

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {A Bayesian approach to estimate bias and uncertainty in snowfall precipitation from {MERRA}-2 and other precipitation products was applied over High Mountain Asia ({HMA}), using a newly developed snow reanalysis method. Starting from an “uninformed” prior probability distribution, a posterior scaling factor applied to {MERRA}2 snowfall was derived by constraining model-based estimates of seasonal snow accumulation and ablation over the water year ({WY}) with fractional snow covered area ({fSCA}) measurements derived from Landsat and {MODIS} ({MODSCAG}). Several subdomains (nine representative 1◦ by 1◦ tiles) across {HMA} were examined over the period {WYs} 2001–2015 and compiled into an uncertainty parameterization where a lognormal distribution was ﬁtted to the empirical posterior distribution with a mean of 1.54 (median of 1.19) and coefﬁcient of variation ({CV}) of 0.83, indicating that {MERRA}-2 underestimates snowfall on average by ∼54\% with sizeable uncertainty. For reference, the uncertainties in snowfall precipitation from the {ERA}5 and {APHRODITE}2 precipitation products were also evaluated, and these products were found to underestimate snowfall, on average by a factor around 1.78 and 3.34 (with median scaling factors of 1.42 and 2.51), respectively. The results indicate that snowfall precipitation at high-elevations dominated by snowfall is underestimated in most existing products, especially in the gauge-based {APHRODITE}-2 product, where the biases were also found to exhibit geographical variations with the largest underestimation in monsoon-inﬂuenced high-elevation tiles. The derived {MERRA}-2 uncertainty model is being used to develop a full domain-wide {HMA} snow reanalysis, which will shed further light onto the space-time variations in snowfall biases in these products.},

	url = {https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2021-139/},
	abstract = {Seasonal snowpack is an essential component in the hydrological cycle and plays a significant role in supplying water resources to downstream users. Yet the snow water equivalent ({SWE}) in seasonal snowpacks, and its space-time variation, remains highly uncertain, especially over mountainous areas with complex terrain and sparse observations, such as 10 in High-Mountain Asia ({HMA}). In this work, we assessed the spatiotemporal distribution of seasonal {SWE}, obtained from a new 18-year {HMA} Snow Reanalysis ({HMASR}) dataset, as part of the recent {NASA} High-Mountain Asia Team ({HiMAT}) effort. A Bayesian snow reanalysis scheme previously developed to assimilate satellite derived fractional snow-covered area ({fSCA}) products from Landsat and {MODIS} platforms has been applied to develop the {HMASR} dataset (at a spatial resolution of 16 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}500 m) and daily temporal resolution) over the joint Landsat-{MODIS} period covering Water 15 Years ({WYs}) 2000-2017. Based on the results, the {HMA}-wide total {SWE} volume is found to be around 163 km3 on average and ranges from 114 km3 ({WY}2001) to 227 km3 ({WY}2005) when assessed over 18 {WYs}. The most abundant snowpacks are found in the northwestern basins (e.g. Indus, Syr Darya and Amu Darya) that are mainly affected by the westerlies, accounting for around 66\% of total seasonal {SWE} volume. When examining the elevational distribution over the {HMA} domain, seasonal {SWE} volume peaks at mid-elevations (around 3500 m), with over 50\% of the volume stored above 3500 20 m. This work brings new insight into understanding the climatology and variability of seasonal snowpack over {HMA}, with the regional snow reanalysis constrained by remote sensing data, providing a new reference dataset for future studies of seasonal snow and how it contributes to the water cycle and climate over the {HMA} region.},

General (G) and detailed (D) simulations were developed based on assessment of the Tien Shan glacier recession between 1943 and 2003 using an iterative stepwise increase in the equilibrium line altitude of 20 m. The G simulation was developed for 2777 grids each of which covered over 1000 km2 of glacier surface and D for the 15 953 Tien Shan glaciers. Both simulations employed glacier morphometric characteristics derived from Digital Elevation Model based on remote sensing data, high resolution maps and in situ {GPS} validation. Simulated changes in glacier area demonstrated that a possible increase in air temperature of 1 ◦C at E¯ {LA} must be compensated by a 100 mm increase in precipitation at the same altitude if Tien Shan glaciers are to be maintained in their current state. An increase in mean air temperature of 4 ◦C and precipitation of 1.1 times the current level could increase E¯ {LA} by 570 m during the 21st century. Under these conditions, the number of glaciers, glacier covered area, glacier volume, and glacier runoff are predicted to be 94\%, 69\%, 75\%, and 75\% of current values. The maximum glacier runoff may reach as much as 1.25 times current levels while the minimum will likely equal zero.},

	abstract = {Millions of people in the geopolitically important region of Central Asia depend on water from snow- and glacier-melt driven international rivers, most of all the Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The riparian countries of these rivers have experienced recurring water allocation conflicts ever since the Soviet Union col- lapsed. Will climate change exacerbate water stress and thus conflicts? We have developed a coupled climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya to quantify impacts and show that climatic changes are likely to have consequences on runoff seasonality due to earlier snow-melt. This will increase water stress in unregulated catchments because less water will be available for irrigation in the summer months. Threats from geohazards, above all glacier lake outbursts, are likely to increase as well. The area at highest risk is the densely populated, agricultur- ally productive, and politically unstable Fergana Valley. Targeted infrastructural developments will be required in the region. If the current mismanagement of water and energy resources can be replaced with more effective resource allocation mechanisms through the strengthening of transboundary institutions, Central Asia will be able to successfully address these future climate-related challenges.},

The comparison is performed for 148 Austrian catchments in the period 1991–2000. On average, about 5 to 7 scatterometer images per month with a mean spatial coverage of about 37\% are available. The results indicate that the agreement between the two top soil moisture estimates changes with the season and the weight given to the scatterometer in hydrologic model calibration. The hydrologic model generally simulates larger top soil moisture values than are observed by the scatterometer. The differences tend to be smaller for lower altitudes and the winter season. The average correlation between the two estimates is more than 0.5 in the period from July to October, and about 0.2 in the winter months, depending on the period and calibration setting. Using both {ERS} scatterometer based soil moisture and runoff for model calibration provides more robust model parameters than using either of these two sources of information.},

	title = {Regionalisation of catchment model parameters},
	abstract = {We simulate the water balance dynamics of 308 catchments in Austria using a lumped conceptual model involving 11 calibration parameters. We calibrate and verify the model for two non-overlapping 11-year periods of daily runoff data. A comparison of the calibrated parameter values of the two periods suggests that all parameters are associated with some uncertainty although the degree of uncertainty differs between the parameters. The regional patterns of the calibrated parameters can be interpreted based on hydrological process reasoning indicating that they are able to represent the regional or large-scale differences in the hydrological conditions. Catchment attributes explain some of the spatial parameter variability with coefﬁcients of determination of up to R2 ¼ 0:27; but usually the R2 values are lower. Parameter uncertainty does not seem to cloud the relationship between calibrated parameters and catchment attributes to a signiﬁcant extent as suggested by an optimised correlation analysis. The median Nash –Sutcliffe efﬁciencies of simulating streamﬂow decrease from 0.67 to 0.63 when moving from the calibration to the veriﬁcation period. This is a small decrease, which suggests that problems with overparameterisation of the model are unlikely. We then compare regionalisation methods for estimating the model parameters in ungauged catchments, in terms of the model performance. The best regionalisation methods are the use of the average parameters of immediate upstream and downstream (nested) neighbours and regionalisation by kriging. For the calibration period, the average decrease in the Nash– Sutcliffe model efﬁciency, as a result of the regionalisation, is 0.10 which is about twice the decrease of moving from the calibration to the veriﬁcation period. The methods based on multiple regressions with catchment attributes perform signiﬁcantly poorer. Apparently, spatial proximity is a better surrogate of unknown controls on runoff dynamics than catchment attributes.},

The present paper describes the structure and calibration of a semi-lumped conceptual glaciohydrological model for the joint simulation of daily discharge and annual glacier mass balance that represents a better integrator of the water balance. The model has been developed for climate change impact studies and has therefore a parsimonious structure; it requires three input times series – precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration – and has 7 parameters to calibrate. A multi-signal approach considering daily discharge and – if available – annual glacier mass balance has been developed for the calibration of these parameters. The model has been calibrated for three different catchments in the Swiss Alps having glaciation rates between 37\% and 52\%. It simulates well the observed daily discharge, the hydrological regime and some basic glaciological features, such as the annual mass balance.},

Such estimates are available through distributed snow models which in some situations can be improved by assimilation of remote sensing observations. However, in regions with frequent cloud cover, complex topography, or large snow amounts satellite observations may feature information of limited quality. In this study, we examine whether assimilation of snow water equivalent ({SWE}) data from ground observations can improve model simulations in a region largely lacking reliable remote sensing observations. We combine the model output with the point data using three-dimensional sequential data assimilation methods, the ensemble Kalman filter, and statistical interpolation. The filter performance was assessed by comparing the simulation results against observed {SWE} and snow-covered fraction. We find that a method which assimilates fluxes (snowfall and melt rates computed from {SWE}) showed higher model performance than a control simulation not utilizing the filter algorithms. However, an alternative approach for updating the model results using the {SWE} data directly did not show a significantly higher performance than the control simulation. The results show that three-dimensional data assimilation methods can be useful for transferring information from point snow observations to the distributed snow model.},

	abstract = {Spatially distributed snow cover information is important for the assessment of climate-related variability of water resources and for calibration and validation of hydrological models in snow-dominated regions. Near-real-time snow cover data can be valuable for short term to seasonal streamflow prediction. Such information can be extracted using remote sensing techniques with good accuracy. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) snow cover data, meanwhile available for more than 15 years, have been shown to be useful for monitoring snow cover extent in remote areas. This data can be processed and used with only 2-day delay, which is sufficient for many water resources management purposes. However, processing remote sensing data require knowledge and computational skills to handle large amounts of data. Moreover, cloud obscuration in optical remote sensing such as {MODIS} may lead to data gaps. These limitations impede the use of the freely available {MODIS} data for water resources management in developing countries, particularly in snow-dominated mountainous regions. To overcome this, we present the all-in-one software package {MODSNOW}-Tool. It processes raw {MODIS} data and eliminates cloud cover using advanced cloud removal algorithms. The ready-to-use output of the {MODSNOW}-Tool is a cloud-free snow cover map and a daily report, which includes spatiotemporal snow statistics for pre-defined river basins. The accuracy of cloud-eliminated {MODSNOW} snow cover maps was validated for 84 almost cloud-free days in the Karadarya river basin in Central Asia, and an average accuracy of 94 \% was achieved. The {MODSNOW}-Tool can be used in operational and non-operational mode. In the operational mode, the tool is set up as a scheduled task on a local computer allowing automatic execution without user interaction and delivers snow cover maps on a daily basis. In the non-operational mode, the tool can be used to process historical time series of snow cover maps from {MODIS}.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-{contentHeaderColor}"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The semi-arid regions of Central Asia crucially depend on the water resources supplied by the mountainous areas of the Tien Shan and Pamir and Altai mountains. During the summer months the snow-melt- and glacier-melt-dominated river discharge originating in the mountains provides the main water resource available for agricultural production, but also for storage in reservoirs for energy generation during the winter months. Thus a reliable seasonal forecast of the water resources is crucial for sustainable management and planning of water resources. In fact, seasonal forecasts are mandatory tasks of all national hydro-meteorological services in the region. In order to support the operational seasonal forecast procedures of hydro-meteorological services, this study aims to develop a generic tool for deriving statistical forecast models of seasonal river discharge based solely on observational records. The generic model structure is kept as simple as possible in order to be driven by meteorological and hydrological data readily available at the hydro-meteorological services, and to be applicable for all catchments in the region. As snow melt dominates summer runoff, the main meteorological predictors for the forecast models are monthly values of winter precipitation and temperature, satellite-based snow cover data, and antecedent discharge. This basic predictor set was further extended by multi-monthly means of the individual predictors, as well as composites of the predictors. Forecast models are derived based on these predictors as linear combinations of up to four predictors. A user-selectable number of the best models is extracted automatically by the developed model fitting algorithm, which includes a test for robustness by a leave-one-out cross-validation. Based on the cross-validation the predictive uncertainty was quantified for every prediction model. Forecasts of the mean seasonal discharge of the period April to September are derived every month from January until June. The application of the model for several catchments in Central Asia – ranging from small to the largest rivers (240 to 290\&thinsp;000\&thinsp;km{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} catchment area) – for the period 2000–2015 provided skilful forecasts for most catchments already in January, with adjusted {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} values of the best model in the range of 0.6–0.8 for most of the catchments. The skill of the prediction increased every following month, i.e. with reduced lead time, with adjusted {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} values usually in the range 0.8–0.9 for the best and 0.7–0.8 on average for the set of models in April just before the prediction period. The later forecasts in May and June improve further due to the high predictive power of the discharge in the first 2 months of the snow melt period. The improved skill of the set of forecast models with decreasing lead time resulted in narrow predictive uncertainty bands at the beginning of the snow melt period. In summary, the proposed generic automatic forecast model development tool provides robust predictions for seasonal water availability in Central Asia, which{\textless}span id="page2226"/{\textgreater} will be tested against the official forecasts in the upcoming years, with the vision of operational implementation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) employed by Terra and Aqua satellites provides spatially snow covered data with 500 m and daily temporal resolution. It delivers public domain data in raster format. The main disadvantage of the {MODIS} sensor is that it is unable to record observations under cloud covered regions. This is why this study focuses on estimating the pixel cover for cloud covered areas where no information is available. Our step to this product involves employing methodology based on six successive steps that estimate the pixel cover using different temporal and spatial information. The study was carried out for the Kokcha River basin located in northeastern part of Afghanistan. Snow coverage in catchments, like Kokcha, is very important where the melt-water from snow dominates the river discharge in vegetation period for irrigation purposes. Since no snow related observations were available from the region, the performance of the proposed methodology was tested using the cloud generated {MODIS} snow cover data as possible “ground truth” information. The results show successful performances arising from the methods applied, which resulted in all cloud coverage being removed. A validation was carried out for all subsequent steps, to be outlined below, where each step removes progressively more cloud coverage. Steps 2 to 5 (step 1 was not validated) performed very well with an average accuracy of between 90–96\%, when applied one after another for the selected valid days in this study. The sixth step was the least accurate at 78\%, but it led to the removal of all remaining cloud cover.},

	abstract = {Taking northern Xinjiang, China, as an example, this study first compares the standard {MODIS} Terra and Aqua snow cover classifications, and then compares the accuracy of the standard {MODIS} daily and 8-day snow cover products with the new daily and multi-day snow cover combination of {MODIS} Terra and Aqua observations using in situ measurements. Under clear sky in both products, the agreement of land classification from {MODIS} Terra and Aqua daily and 8-day snow cover products is close to 100\% for a entire water year. In contrast, the agreement of snow classification from {MODIS} Terra and Aqua is high only in the winter months, decreasing in the rest of the period. The high agreement mainly concentrates in land or snow-dominated areas, and major disagreements take place in the transitions zones from snow to land. The disagreement (mainly snow–land) in the 8-day products is higher than that in the daily products. In addition, both {MODIS} Terra and Aqua cloud masks tend to map more areas in the transition zones as cloud. Under clear sky conditions, the three daily products have similar accuracy of snow and land classification, and the 8-day standard products and the multi-day combination product also have similar accuracy of snow and land classification. This further suggests that the algorithm in the combination of Terra and Aqua snow cover products is valid. Moreover, in the actual weather/cloud conditions, the combination products from Terra and Aqua reduce cloud blockage and improve snow classification accuracy against either {MODIS} Terra or Aqua (51\% against 44\% and 34\% for daily and 92\% against 87\% and 78\% for 8-day, respectively), although Terra snow product (daily or 8-day) has slightly better accuracy than the Aqua snow product. The new combination products can provide better mapping of spatiotemporal variation of snow cover/glacier and for snow-melting modeling. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The analysis included comparisons of mean basin values and correlation of anomalies, as well as seasonal and interannual variabilities and trends. {ERA}-40 generally provided better estimates of mean {SWE} values for river basins than did the {NCEP}–{DOE} reanalysis. Mean {SD} values from the {JRA}-25 reanalysis were systematically underestimated. The best correlations among the anomalies were given by {ERA}-40, followed by {JRA}-25. All reanalyses reproduced seasonal variability well, although the differences in absolute values varied substantially. The highest differences were typically connected with the snowmelt period (April and May). Interannual variability confirmed the errors of {ERA}-40 and {JRA}-25 in 1992–94 and 1979–83, respectively. Otherwise, the reproduction of the interannual variability of {SWE} and {SD} was reasonable. Strong biases in {SD} data from {JRA}-25 that decrease with time induce artificial positive trends. Significant underestimations of {SWE} data by {ERA}-40 for 1991–94 influenced the values of the trends. {NCEP}–{DOE} reasonably represented the trend found in measured data. In general, the highest discrepancies between measured and reanalysis data were found for the northern European and eastern Asian rivers (Pechora, Lena, and Amur). The assessment of the quality of {SWE} and {SD} reanalysis data can help potential users in the selection of a particular reanalysis as being appropriate to the purpose of their studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The results show an overall snow agreement between {MODIS} and ground observations of 93.1 and 92.7\% for {MODIS} Terra and {MODIS} Aqua snow products, respectively. The agreement between {MODIS} and Landsat is 91.9\% when considering snow and land agreements. The snow fraction product from {MODIS} is also validated using Landsat data, and varying accuracies are obtained. The main disadvantage of the {MODIS} snow cover product are the cloud induced gaps. Therefore, cloud covered pixels are eliminated using the {ModSnow} algorithm.

The spatiotemporal variability of erosivity depending on precipitation using the rainfall erosivity (R) of Universal Soil Loss Equation under the global circulation model ({GCM}) scenarios in the Chirchik–Akhangaran Basin ({CHAB}), which is in the northeastern part of the Republic of Uzbekistan, was statistically downscaled by using the delta method in Representative Concentration Pathways ({RCPs}) 4.5 and 8.5 during the periods of the 2030s, 2050s and 2070s. The (R) was used to determine the erosivity of precipitation, and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation ({RUSLE}) itself determined the eﬀects of changes in erosivity. Ten weather station observational data points for the period from 1990 to 2016 were used to validate the global circulation models ({GCMs}) and erosion model. The assessment results showed an increase in precipitation from the baseline by an average of 11.8\%, 14.1\% and 16.3\% for all models by 2030, 2050 and 2070, respectively, while at the same time, soil loss increased in parallel with precipitation by 17.1\%, 20.5 \% and 23.3\%, respectively, in certain scenarios. The highest rainfall was observed for the models {ACCESS}1–3 and {CanESM}2 on both {RCPs} and periods, while more intense rainfall was the main reason for the increase in the spatial and temporal erosion activity of the rainfall-runoﬀ.

	abstract = {A new snow reanalysis method is presented that is designed to jointly assimilate Landsat- and {MODIS}-derived ({MODSCAG}) fractional snow covered area ({fSCA}) to characterize seasonal snow in remote regions like High Mountain Asia ({HMA}) where in situ data is severely lacking. The method leverages existing readily available global datasets for forcing a snow model and uses the {fSCA} retrievals along with the ensemble prior model estimates to derive posterior estimates using a Bayesian framework. The method addresses {MODIS} viewing-geometry effects on the {fSCA} retrievals by accounting for viewing angle dependent measurement errors and using a {CDF}-matching technique to improve the joint {fSCA} measurement consistency before assimilation. The method was veriﬁed through comparison with the Airborne Snow Observatory ({ASO}) snow water equivalent ({SWE}) estimates over the Tuolumne River watershed in California. The posterior {SWE} estimates were shown to be much more consistent with the independent {ASO} estimates across the three {WYs} examined. Tests over Tuolumne showed that in cases where sufﬁcient Landsat observations are available (i.e., with multiple sensors and in areas of overlapping Landsat tiles), assimilation of only Landsat data may be optimal, which is attributable primarily to the higher spatial resolution of the raw Landsat data, but that in cases with fewer Landsat measurements (i.e., with single Landsat tiles and/or signiﬁcant reduction due to clouds), the additional screened and {CDF}-matched {MODIS}-based measurements can have a positive (albeit marginal) impact. Illustrative results are presented for nine {HMA} test tiles to illustrate how the method can provide posterior estimates of the space-time climatology of {SWE} storage in areas where in situ data does not generally exist. Ongoing work is being conducted to use the method outlined herein to generate an {HMA}-wide reanalysis dataset that will provide an opportunity for a more thorough characterization of {HMA} seasonal snow storage and dynamics over the joint Landsat-{MODIS} era. The method is generalizable to any midlatitude montane region where seasonal snow is important.},

The goal of this paper is to distinguish the specific contribution of seasonal snow versus glacier ice melt in the major basins of High Mountain Asia: Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya. Our methodology involves the application of {MODIS}-derived remote sensing products to separately calculate daily melt outputs from snow and glacier ice. Using an automated partitioning method, we generate daily maps of (1) snow over glacier ice, (2) exposed glacier ice, and (3) snow over land. These are inputs to a temperature index model that yields melt water volumes contributing to river flow. Results for the five major High Mountain Asia basins show that the western regions are heavily reliant on snow and ice melt sources for summer dry season flow when demand is at a peak, whereas monsoon rainfall dominates runoff during the summer period in the east. While uncertainty remains in the temperature index model applied here, our approach to partitioning melt from seasonal snow and glacier ice is both innovative and systematic and more constrained than previous efforts with similar goals.},

This study aims to clarify the drivers of water stress across the 440 km Naryn River basin, headwater stem to the Syr Darya and the disappearing North Aral Sea. We use a combination of human and physical geography approaches to understand the meltwater-controlled hydrology of the system (using hydrochemical mixing models) as well as the human-water experience (via community surveys). Surveys indicate that current water stress is primarily a function of water management and access issues resulting from the clunky transition from Soviet era large-scale agriculture to post-Soviet small-plot farming. Snow and ice meltwaters play a dominant role in the surface and ground water supplies to downstream communities across the study’s 4220 m elevation gradient, so future increases to water stress due to changes in volume and timing of water supply is likely given frozen waters’ high sensitivities to warming temperatures. The combined influence of social, political and climate-induced pressures on water supplies in the Naryn basin suggest the need for proactive planning and adaptation strategies, and warrant concern for similar melt-sourced Central Asian watersheds.},

Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30–40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas.},

Area mapping uncertainty was evaluated at three study sites, Mount Qomolangma (Everest), Mount Naimona’Nyi, Mount Geladandong, where the largest differences between present and earlier measurements were within ∼±4\%. Area differences with previous inventories ranged from −19.6\% ({TPG}1976 minus the first Chinese Glacier Inventory) to −3.6\% and −1.1\% ({TPG}2013 and {TPG}2001, respectively minus the second Chinese Glacier Inventory), while the difference {TPG}2001 minus the {GAMDAM} Glacier Inventory was +10.4\%.

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that high elevation environments are among very sensitive to climatic changes and where impacts are exacerbated. Across Central Asia, which is especially vulnerable to climate change due to aridity, the ability of global climate projections to capture the complex dynamics of mountainous environments is particularly limited. Over montane Central Asia, agropastoralism constitutes a major portion of the rural economy. Extensive herbaceous vegetation forms the basis of rural economies in Kyrgyzstan. Here we focus on snow cover seasonality and the effects of terrain on phenology in highland pastures using remote sensing data for 2001–2017. First, we describe the thermal regime of growing season using {MODerate} Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ({MODIS}) land surface temperature ({LST}) data, analyzing the modulation by elevation, slope, and aspect. We then characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from modeling the land surface phenology using Landsat normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) time series together with {MODIS} {LST} data. Using rank correlations, we then analyzed the influence of four metrics of snow cover seasonality calculated from {MODIS} snow cover composites—first date of snow, late date of snow, duration of snow season, and the number of snow-covered dates ({SCD})—on two key metrics of land surface phenology in the subsequent growing season, specifically, peak height ({PH}; the maximum modeled {NDVI}) and thermal time to peak ({TTP}; the amount of growing degree-days accumulated during modeled green-up phase). We evaluated the role of terrain features in shaping the relationships between snow cover metrics and land surface phenology metrics using exact multinomial tests of equivalence. Key findings include (1) a positive relationship between {SCD} and {PH} occurred in over 1664 km2 at p {\textless} 0.01 and 5793 km2 at p {\textless} 0.05, which account for {\textgreater}8\% of 68,881 km2 of the pasturelands analyzed in Kyrgyzstan; (2) more negative than positive correlations were found between snow cover onset and {PH}, and more positive correlations were observed between snowmelt timing and {PH}, indicating that a longer snow season can positively influence {PH}; (3) significant negative correlations between {TTP} and {SCD} appeared in 1840 km2 at p {\textless} 0.01 and 6208 km2 at p {\textless} 0.05, and a comparable but smaller area showed negative correlations between {TTP} and last date of snow (1538 km2 at p {\textless} 0.01 and 5188 km2 at p {\textless} 0.05), indicating that under changing climatic conditions toward earlier spring warming, decreased duration of snow cover may lead to lower pasture productivity, thereby threatening the sustainability of montane agropastoralism; and (4) terrain had a stronger influence on the timing of last date of snow cover than on the number of snow-covered dates, with slope being more important than aspect, and the strongest effect appearing from the interaction of aspect and steeper slopes. In this study, we characterized the snow-phenology interactions in highland pastures and revealed strong dependencies of pasture phenology on timing of snowmelt and the number of snow-covered dates.},

Accordingly, freshwater supply is strongly depending on the amount of accumulated snow as well as the moment of its release after snowmelt. The aim of the presented study is to identify possible changes in snow cover characteristics, consisting of snow cover duration, onset and offset of snow cover season within the last 28 years. Relying on remotely sensed data originating from medium resolution imagers, these snow cover characteristics are extracted on a daily basis. The resolution of 500–1000 m allows for a subsequent analysis of changes on the scale of hydrological sub-catchments. Long-term changes are identified from this unique dataset, revealing an ongoing shift towards earlier snowmelt within the Central Asian Mountains. This shift can be observed in most upstream hydro catchments within Pamir and Tian Shan Mountains and it leads to a potential change of freshwater availability in the downstream regions, exerting additional pressure on the already tensed situation.},

The objective of this study is to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of different {NDSI} thresholds used for snow cover mapping and to compare the results with former snow cover classification based on a fixed {NDSI} threshold ({NDSI} = 0.4). The accuracy is tested for both Aqua ({MYD}10A1) and Terra ({MOD}10A1) daily snow cover products by using daily snow depth observations at 665 climate stations in Austria in the period 2002–2014. The results show the overall classification accuracy over 665 climate stations to be larger than 97\% (97.4\% for Terra and 97.6\% for Aqua) in Austria. The best {NDSI} thresholds fitted to individual stations can differ from a fixed threshold ({NDSI} = 0.4) and are sensitive to the snow depth threshold indicating snow cover at the ground. The {NDSI} thresholds vary seasonally, decrease with increasing elevation and are lower in forested than open land cover settings. We found that the {NDSI} thresholds fitted to different elevation and land cover classes improve regional snow cover mapping by 3–10\% in forested regions above 900 m a.s.l. in January to March.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Knowledge of current snow cover extent is
essential for characterizing energy and moisture fluxes at the Earth's
surface. The snow-covered area ({SCA}) is often estimated by using optical
satellite information in combination with the normalized-difference snow
index ({NDSI}). The {NDSI} thereby uses a threshold for the definition if a
satellite pixel is assumed to be snow covered or snow free. The
spatiotemporal representativeness of the standard threshold of 0.4 is
however questionable at the local scale. Here, we use local snow cover maps
derived from ground-based photography to continuously calibrate the {NDSI}
threshold values ({NDSIthr}) of Landsat satellite images at two
European mountain sites of the period from 2010 to 2015. The
Research Catchment Zugspitzplatt ({RCZ}, Germany) and Vernagtferner area
({VF}, Austria) are both located within a single Landsat scene. Nevertheless, the
long-term analysis of the {NDSIthr} demonstrated that the
{NDSIthr} at these sites are not correlated (r = 0.17) and different
than the standard threshold of 0.4. For further comparison, a dynamic and locally
optimized {NDSI} threshold was used as well as another locally optimized
literature threshold value (0.7). It was shown that large uncertainties in
the prediction of the {SCA} of up to 24.1 \% exist in satellite snow cover
maps in cases where the standard threshold of 0.4 is used, but a newly
developed calibrated quadratic polynomial model which accounts for
seasonal threshold dynamics can reduce this error. The model minimizes the
{SCA} uncertainties at the calibration site {VF} by 50 \% in the evaluation
period and was also able to improve the results at {RCZ} in a significant way.
Additionally, a scaling experiment shows that the positive effect of a locally adapted
threshold diminishes using a pixel size of 500 m or larger,
underlining the general applicability of the standard threshold at larger scales.},

The analysis is performed in 213 catchments in Austria for the period 2000–2014. An {HBV} (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning)-type hydrologic model is calibrated based on runoff
data, {ASCAT} soil moisture data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) snow cover data for various
calibration variants. Results show that the inclusion of soil moisture data
in the calibration mainly improves the soil moisture simulations, the
inclusion of snow data mainly improves the snow simulations, and the inclusion of both of them improves both soil moisture and snow simulations to almost the same extent. The snow data are more efficient at improving snow simulations than the soil moisture data are at improving soil moisture simulations. The improvements of both runoff and soil moisture model efficiencies are larger in low elevation and agricultural catchments than in others. The calibrated snow-related parameters are strongly affected by including snow data and, to a lesser extent, by soil moisture data. In contrast, the soil-related parameters are only affected by the inclusion of soil moisture data. The results indicate that the use of multiple remote sensing products in hydrological modeling can improve the representation of hydrological fluxes and prediction of runoff hydrographs at the catchment scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Understanding travel times and hydrological pathways of rain and snowmelt
water transported through the landscape to recipient surface waters is
critical in many hydrological and biogeochemical investigations. In this
study, a particle-tracking model approach in Mike {SHE} was used to investigate the pathway and its associated travel time of water in 14 partly
nested, long-term monitored boreal sub-catchments of the Krycklan catchment
(0.12–68 km2). This region is characterized by long and snow-rich winters with little groundwater recharge and highly dynamic runoff during spring snowmelt. The geometric mean of the annual travel time distribution
({MTTgeo}) for the studied sub-catchments varied from 0.8 to 2.7 years. The variations were related to the different landscape types and their varying
hydrological responses during different seasons. Winter {MTTgeo} ranged from 1.2 to 7.7 years, while spring {MTTgeo} varied from 0.5 to 1.9 years. The modelled variation in annual and seasonal {MTTgeo} and the fraction of
young water ({\textless}3 months) was supported by extensive observations of
both δ18O and base cation concentrations in the different
streams. The travel time of water to streams was positively correlated with the area coverage of low-conductive silty sediments (r=0.90, P{\textless}0.0001). Catchments with mixed soil–landscape settings typically displayed larger variability in seasonal {MTTgeo}, as contrasting hydrological
responses between different soil types (e.g. peat in mires, till and silty
sediments) are integrated. The areal coverage of mires was especially
important for the young water contribution in spring (r=0.96, P{\textless}0.0001). The main factor for this was attributed to extensive soil frost in
mires, causing considerable overland flow during the snowmelt period.
However, this lower groundwater recharge during snowmelt caused
mire-dominated catchments to have longer stream runoff {MTTgeo} than
comparable forest catchments in winter. Boreal landscapes are sensitive to
climate change, and our results suggest that changes in seasonality are
likely to cause contrasting responses in different catchments depending on
the dominating landscape type.},

They provide realizations of plausible but as yet unobserved streamﬂow time series with the same temporal and distributional characteristics as the observed data. However, the representation of non-stationarities and spatial dependence among sites remains a challenge in stochastic modeling. We investigate whether the use of frequency-domain instead of time-domain models allows for the joint simulation of realistic, continuous streamﬂow time series at daily resolution and spatial extremes at multiple sites. To do so, we propose the stochastic simulation approach called Phase Randomization Simulation using wavelets ({PRSim}.wave) which combines an empirical spatio-temporal model based on the wavelet transform and phase randomization with the ﬂexible four-parameter kappa distribution. The approach consists of ﬁve steps: (1) derivation of random phases, (2) ﬁtting of the kappa distribution, (3) wavelet transform, (4) inverse wavelet transform, and (5) transformation to kappa distribution. We apply and evaluate {PRSim}.wave on a large set of 671 catchments in the contiguous United States. We show that this approach allows for the generation of realistic time series at multiple sites exhibiting short- and long-range dependence, non-stationarities, and unobserved extreme events. Our evaluation results strongly suggest that the ﬂexible, continuous simulation approach is potentially valuable for a diverse range of water management applications where the reproduction of spatial dependencies is of interest. Examples include the development of regional water management plans, the estimation of regional ﬂood or drought risk, or the estimation of regional hydropower potential.},

	abstract = {A terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modelling process, its interaction with the broader water management process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modelling processes. Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment and characterisation: data uncertainty engine ({DUE}), error propagation equations, expert elicitation, extended peer review, inverse modelling (parameter estimation), inverse modelling (predictive uncertainty), Monte Carlo analysis, multiple model simulation, {NUSAP}, quality assurance, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, stakeholder involvement and uncertainty matrix. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modelling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed. It is concluded that uncertainty assessment is not just something to be added after the completion of the modelling work. Instead uncertainty should be seen as a red thread throughout the modelling study starting from the very beginning, where the identiﬁcation and characterisation of all uncertainty sources should be performed jointly by the modeller, the water manager and the stakeholders.

	abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale’, ‘observation scale’ and ‘modelling (working) scale’ require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that upscaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptualizations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking conceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

The importance of a rigorous and purposeful parameterisation is emphasized in order to get as few ‘‘free’’ parameters as possible for which assessments through calibration are required. Calibration and validation using a split-sample procedure were carried out for catchment discharge and piezometric heads at seven selected observation wells. The validated model was then used for two further validation tests. Firstly, model simulations were compared with observations from three additional discharge sites and four additional wells located within the catchment. This internal validation showed signiﬁcantly poorer results compared to the calibration/validation sites. Secondly, the validated model based on a 500 m model grid was used to generate three additional models with 1000 m, 2000 m and 4000 m grids through interpolation of model parameters. The results from the multi-scale validation suggested that a maximum grid size of 1000 m should be used for simulations of discharge and ground-water heads, while the results deteriorated with coarser model grids.},

Such contributions can be estimated via hydrological models, provided that the modeling adequately accounts for snow and glacier melt, as well as rainfall runoff. We present a multiple data set calibration approach to estimate runoff composition using hydrological models with three levels of complexity. For this purpose, the code of the conceptual runoff model {HBV}-light was enhanced to allow calibration and validation of simulations against glacier mass balances, satellite-derived snow cover area and measured discharge. Three levels of complexity of the model were applied to glacierized catchments in Switzerland, ranging from 39 to 103 km2. The results indicate that all three observational data sets are reproduced adequately by the model, allowing an accurate estimation of the runoff composition in the three mountain streams. However, calibration against only runoff leads to unrealistic snow and glacier melt rates. Based on these results, we recommend using all three observational data sets in order to constrain model parameters and compute snow, glacier, and rain contributions. Finally, based on the comparison of model performance of different complexities, we postulate that the availability and use of different data sets to calibrate hydrological models might be more important than model complexity to achieve realistic estimations of runoff composition.},

The methodology is based on an indirect comparison of snow water equivalent simulated by the hydrologic model and the {MODIS} snow cover data. The analysis is performed for 148 catchments in Austria using the original Terra and Aqua {MODIS} images as well as {MODIS} snow cover products based on the combination of Terra and Aqua and on different spatial and temporal ﬁlters that reduce cloud coverage by using information from neighbouring non-cloud covered pixels in space or time. The results indicate that the use of the {MODIS} snow cover data improves the snow model performance as measured against independent ground snow depth data. In a veriﬁcation mode, the median snow cover overestimation error of 7.1\% of mismatch decreases to 5.6\% and the corresponding underestimation error decreases from 4.7 to 4.1\% if the combined {MODIS} data are used for calibration as compared to the case where no {MODIS} data are used. {MODIS} snow cover data also slightly improve the runoff model performance. In a veriﬁcation mode, the median runoff model efﬁciency increases from 0.67 to 0.70 if {MODIS} data are used for calibration as compared to the case where no {MODIS} data are used. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the magnitude of the model efﬁciency is sensitive to the choice of the threshold of snow covered area used in estimating the snow underestimation errors, and the cloud cover threshold used in deciding whether a {MODIS} image can be used for model analysis. Evaluation of the model performance against merged {MODIS} snow products shows that the combination and ﬁltering of the Aqua and Terra images does not signiﬁcantly affect the runoff and snow model efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {Runoff estimation in ungauged catchments is probably one of the most basic and oldest tasks of hydrologists. This long-standing issue has received increased attention recently due to the {PUB} (Prediction in Ungauged Basins) initiative. Given the challenges of predicting runoff for ungauged catchments one might argue that the best course of action is to take a few runoff measurements. In this study we explored how implementing such a procedure might support predictions in an ungauged basin. We used a number of monitored Swedish catchments as hypothetical ungauged basins where we pretended to start with no runoff data and then added different sub-sets of the available data to constrain a simple catchment model. These sub-sets consisted of a limited number of single runoff measurements; in other words these data represent what could be measured with limited efforts in an ungauged basin. We used a Monte Carlo approach and predicted runoff as a weighted ensemble mean of simulations using acceptable parameter sets. We found that the ensemble prediction clearly outperformed the predictions using single parameter sets and that surprisingly little runoff data was necessary to identify model parameterizations that provided good results for the “ungauged” test periods. These results indicated that a few runoff measurements can contain much of the information content of continuous runoff time series. However, the study also indicated that results may differ signiﬁcantly between catchments and also depend on the days chosen for taking the measurements.},

However, language is alive, and just like regular speech, scientific terminology changes. Frequently, those changes are grounded on a solid rationale, but sometimes these semantic transitions have a fragile foundation. That is the case with “evapotranspiration.” A growing generation of scientists have been educated on using this terminology and are unaware of the historical controversy and physical inconsistency that surrounds it. Here, we present what may appear to some as an esoteric linguistic discussion, yet it was originally triggered by the increasing time some of us have devoted to justifying our word choice to reviewers, editors, and peers. By clarifying our arguments for using the term “evaporation,” we also seek to prevent having to revive this discussion every time a new article is submitted, so that we can move directly on to more scientifically relevant matters.},

Change in the snowfall fraction (S/P) is currently assumed not only influences the accumulation and ablation of glaciers, but also influences the streamflow and water resources significantly in mountainous regions. However, until now, most studies have focused on precipitation magnitude and its frequency changes, while seasonal shifts in precipitation types have been mostly neglected. This paper employs the threshold temperature method in combination with multi-source dataset ({APHRODITE}, {CPC} and meteorological stations) analysis to determine snowfall proportions in precipitation in the Tienshan Mountains, Central Asia, during 1960–2017. The results indicated that temperature-induced precipitation shifting from snow to rain. The S/P experienced an overall declining trend, increasing at a rate of 0.6\%/decade prior to the mid-1990s, followed by a downward trend at a rate of −0.5\%/decade. The S/P decreased mainly at low and middle altitudes (between 1500 and 3500 m). At higher altitudes (over 3500 m), the magnitudes of the decreased S/P ratios were small or even increased due to the temperature always being below freezing. Decreases in S/P are always associated with decreases in annual streamflow in the glacier/snow melt recharged rivers.},

	abstract = {Patch degradation of the alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau ({TP}) induced by climate warming and anthropogenic activities affects the pattern of coupled water and heat cycling between the land surface and the atmosphere, which could positively feedback to the regional and global climate warming. However, previous research has mostly focused on the homogeneous underlying surface rather than heterogeneous underlying surface. Thus, this study aims at forming a better understanding of the difference in water and heat exchange over heterogeneous underlying surface in the permafrost region of the {TP} hinterland. We based our analysis on two years of weather and energy flux measurements that were collected over two contrasting landscapes under the same climate conditions: a natural alpine meadow ({AM}) and severely degraded alpine meadow, termed bare land ({BL}). The major surface characteristics affecting the difference between {AM} and {BL} energy budgets are also presented and analyzed (such as land surface albedo and temperature, shallow soil temperature and moisture, soil stratification, and phenology). The results show that the thawing of a shallow active soil layer induced a rapid increase in soil moisture, triggering the dramatic change in main energy partitioning from sensible heat flux (H) to latent heat flux ({LE}) in both {AM} and {BL} sites. Surface albedo decreased but surface cooling increased with the reduction in the vegetation coverage, and temperature gradient between surface and 10cm depth increased with the erosion of root turf that is capable of thermal insulation and high water retention, together could alter the surface energy budget. The annual surface heat source or available energy (Rn−G) in {AM} was approximately equal to that in {BL}. However, more available energy was consumed by H to warm the low atmosphere in {BL} as evidenced by the Bowen ratio increasing from 0.49 to 0.84 in summer and from 2.96 to 5.64 over a whole year. The results of this research suggest that the soil moisture, canopy, and root turf were the major factors affecting the energy partitioning in the hinterland of the {TP}. The decrease in vegetation coverage results in increases of H and heating of the lower atmosphere. Therefore, this could lead to a potential positive feedback to regional climate warming. In addition, given the background of {TP} warming, Kobresia turf can effectively prevent permafrost degradation due to its thermal insulation characteristics.},

Nevertheless, glaciers are one of the most important components of the high-mountain cryosphere in the region as they strongly influence water availability in the arid, continental and intensely populated downstream areas. This study provides reliable and continuous surface mass balance series for selected glaciers located in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay. By cross-validating the results of three independent methods, we reconstructed the mass balance of the three benchmark glaciers, Abramov, Golubin and Glacier no. 354 for the past 2 decades. By applying different approaches, it was possible to compensate for the limitations and shortcomings of each individual method. This study proposes the use of transient snow line observations throughout the melt season obtained from satellite optical imagery and terrestrial automatic cameras. By combining modelling with remotely acquired information on summer snow depletion, it was possible to infer glacier mass changes for unmeasured years. The model is initialized with daily temperature and precipitation data collected at automatic weather stations in the vicinity of the glacier or with adjusted data from climate reanalysis products. Multi-annual mass changes based on high-resolution digital elevation models and in situ glaciological surveys were used to validate the results for the investigated glaciers. Substantial surface mass loss was confirmed for the three studied glaciers by all three methods, ranging from −0.30 ± 0.19 to −0.41 ± 0.33 m w.e. yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$ over the 2004–2016 period. Our results indicate that integration of snow line observations into mass balance modelling significantly narrows the uncertainty ranges of the estimates. Hence, this highlights the potential of the methodology for application to unmonitored glaciers at larger scales for which no direct measurements are available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979-2013. We compare the data derived from the {CHELSA} algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that {CHELSA} climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

	abstract = {The anticipated retreat of glaciers around the globe will pose far-reaching challenges to the management of fresh water resources and significantly contribute to sea-level rise within the coming decades. Here, we present a new model for calculating the 21st century mass changes of all glaciers on Earth outside the ice sheets. The Global Glacier Evolution Model ({GloGEM}) includes mass loss due to frontal ablation at marine-terminating glacier fronts and accounts for glacier advance/retreat and surface Elevation changes. Simulations are driven with monthly near-surface air temperature and precipitation from 14 Global Circulation Models forced by the {RCP}2.6, {RCP}4.5 and {RCP}8.5 emission scenarios. Depending on the scenario, the model yields a global glacier volume loss of 25-48\% between 2010 and 2100. For calculating glacier contribution to sea-level rise, we account for ice located below sea-level presently displacing ocean water. This effect reduces glacier contribution by 11-14\%, so that our model predicts a sea-level equivalent (multi-model mean +-1 standard deviation) of 79+-24 mm ({RCP}2.6), 108+-28 mm ({RCP}4.5) and 157+-31 mm ({RCP}8.5). Mass losses by frontal ablation account for 10\% of total ablation globally, and up to 30\% regionally. Regional equilibrium line altitudes are projected to rise by 100-800 m until 2100, but the effect on ice wastage depends on initial glacier hypsometries.},

	abstract = {Northern Tien Shan is characterised by a distinct periglacial belt that contains many rock glaciers with an area of 1 km2 or more. To investigate the reason for their large size and variable occurrence, we analysed a representative subsample of the rock glaciers with respect to topographic and climatic variables. A simple permafrost model indicates that the rock glaciers originate in the zone where permafrost occurrence is very likely and some large rock glaciers flow down to elevations where permafrost is unlikely to exist outside the rock glaciers themselves. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that the occurrence and characteristics of the rock glaciers can only be partly explained by the characteristics of the contributing area (e.g. its area or the headwall height). The correlation is greater with talus-type rock glaciers than with moraine-type rock glaciers. The climate can explain the general occurrence of rock glaciers but not their specific characteristics. It is hypothesised that the main reason for the specific distribution and characteristics of these large rock glaciers relates to the interaction with polythermal glaciers, topographic characteristics, intensive weathering and rock avalanches triggered by seismic activity.

We find that between 5\% and 14\% of the rock glaciers partly buried, blocked, diverted or constricted at least 95 km of mountain rivers in the entire study area. We use a Bayesian robust logistic regression with multiple topographic and climatic inputs to discern those rock glaciers disrupting mountain rivers from those with no obvious impacts. We identify elevation and potential incoming solar radiation ({PISR}), together with the size of feeder basins, as dominant predictors, so that lower-lying and larger rock glaciers from larger basins are more likely to disrupt river channels. Given that elevation and {PISR} are key inputs for modelling the regional distribution of mountain permafrost from the positions of rock-glacier toes, we infer that river-blocking rock glaciers may be diagnostic of non-equilibrated permafrost. Principal component analysis adds temperature evenness and wet-season precipitation to the controls that characterise rock glaciers impacting on rivers. Depending on the choice of predictors, the accuracy of our classification is moderate to good with median posterior area-under-the-curve values of 0.71–0.89. Clarifying whether rapidly advancing rock glaciers can physically impound rivers, or fortify existing dams instead, deserves future field investigation. We suspect that rock-glacier dams are conspicuous features that have a polygenetic history and encourage more research on the geomorphic coupling between permafrost lobes, river channels, and the sediment cascades of semiarid mountain belts. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The presence of an insulating supraglacial debris cover alters the mass-balance profile of a glacier, potentially modifying the scaling relation. Here, the nature of scaling relations for extensively debris-covered glaciers is investigated. Theoretical arguments suggest that the volume-area scaling exponent for these glaciers is {\textasciitilde}7\% smaller than that for clean glaciers. This is consistent with the results from flowline-model simulations of idealised glaciers, and the available data from the Himalaya. The best-fit scale factor for debris-covered Himalayan glaciers is {\textasciitilde}60\% larger compared to that for the clean ones, implying a significantly larger stored ice volume in a debris-covered glacier compared to a clean one having the same area. These results may help improve scaling-based estimates of glacier volume and future glacier changes in regions where debris-covered glaciers are abundant.},

	abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth’s glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000–2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 ± 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 ± 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 ± 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7–9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Volume-area power law scaling, one of a set of analytical scaling techniques based on principals of dimensional analysis, has become an increasingly important and widely used method for estimating the future response of the world's glaciers and ice caps to environmental change. Over 60 papers since 1988 have been published in the glaciological and environmental change literature containing applications of volume-area scaling, mostly for the purpose of estimating total global glacier and ice cap volume and modeling future contributions to sea level rise from glaciers and ice caps. The application of the theory is not entirely straightforward, however, and many of the recently published results contain analyses that are in conflict with the theory as originally described by Bahr et al. (1997). In this review we describe the general theory of scaling for glaciers in full three-dimensional detail without simplifications, including an improved derivation of both the volume-area scaling exponent γ and a new derivation of the multiplicative scaling parameter c. We discuss some common misconceptions of the theory, presenting examples of both appropriate and inappropriate applications. We also discuss potential future developments in power law scaling beyond its present uses, the relationship between power law scaling and other modeling approaches, and some of the advantages and limitations of scaling techniques.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of the world’s glaciers is a fundamental prerequisite for a range of studies. Projections of future glacier change, estimates of the available freshwater resources or assessments of potential sea-level rise all need glacier ice thickness to be accurately constrained. Previous estimates of global glacier volumes are mostly based on scaling relations between glacier area and volume, and only one study provides global-scale information on the ice thickness distribution of individual glaciers. Here we use an ensemble of up to five models to provide a consensus estimate for the ice thickness distribution of all the about 215,000 glaciers outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The models use principles of ice flow dynamics to invert for ice thickness from surface characteristics. We find a total volume of 158 ± 41 × 103 km3, which is equivalent to 0.32 ± 0.08 m of sea-level change when the fraction of ice located below present-day sea level (roughly 15\%) is subtracted. Our results indicate that High Mountain Asia hosts about 27\% less glacier ice than previously suggested, and imply that the timing by which the region is expected to lose half of its present-day glacier area has to be moved forward by about one decade.},

	abstract = {Global warming is expected to signiﬁcantly affect the runoff regime of mountainous catchments. Simple methods for calculating future glacier change in hydrological models are required in order to reliably assess economic impacts of changes in the water cycle over the next decades. Models for temporal and spatial glacier evolution need to describe the climate forcing acting on the glacier, and ice ﬂow dynamics. Flow models, however, demand considerable computational resources and ﬁeld data input and are moreover not applicable on the regional scale. Here, we propose a simple parameterization for calculating the change in glacier surface elevation and area, which is mass conserving and suited for hydrological modelling. The h-parameterization is an empirical glacier-speciﬁc function derived from observations in the past that can easily be applied to large samples of glaciers. We compare the h-parameterization to results of a 3-D ﬁnite-element ice ﬂow model. As case studies, the evolution of two Alpine glaciers of different size over the period 2008–2100 is investigated using regional climate scenarios. The parameterization closely reproduces the distributed ice thickness change, as well as glacier area and length predicted by the ice ﬂow model. This indicates that for the purpose of transient runoff forecasts, future glacier geometry change can be approximated using a simple parameterization instead of complex ice ﬂow modelling. Furthermore, we analyse alpine glacier response to 21st century climate change and consequent shifts in the runoff regime of a highly glacierized catchment using the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {Volume–area scaling provides a practical alternative to ice-flow modelling to account for glacier size changes when modelling the future evolution of glaciers; however, uncertainties remain as to the validity of this approach under non-steady conditions. We address these uncertainties by deriving scaling exponents in the volume–area relationship from one-dimensional ice-flow modelling. We generate a set of 37 synthetic steady-state glaciers of different sizes, and then model their volume evolution due to climate warming and cooling as prescribed by negative and positive mass-balance perturbations, respectively, on a century timescale. The scaling exponent derived for the steady-state glaciers (  ¼ 1.56) differs from the exponents derived for the glaciers in transient (non-steady) state by up to 86\%. Nevertheless, volume projections employing volume–area scaling are relatively insensitive to these differences in scaling exponents. Volume–area scaling agrees well with the results from ice-flow modelling. In addition, the scaling method is able to simulate the approach of a glacier to a new steady state, if mass-balance elevation feedback is approximated by removing or adding elevation bands at the lowest part of the glacier as the glacier retreats or advances. If area changes are approximated in the mass-balance computations in this way, our results indicate that volume–area scaling is a powerful tool for glacier volume projections on multi-century timescales.},

Based on the synthesis, meta-analysis, and personal modeling experiences, we recommend coefficient of determination (R2; in conjunction with gradient and intercept of the corresponding regression line), Nash Sutcliffe efficiency ({NSE}), index of agreement (d), root mean square error ({RMSE}; alongside the ratio of {RMSE} and standard deviation of measured data, {RSR}), percent bias ({PBIAS}), and several graphical {PMs} to evaluate model performance. We recommend that model performance can be judged “satisfactory” for flow simulations if monthly R2 {\textgreater} 0.70 and d {\textgreater} 0.75 for field-scale models, and daily, monthly, or annual R2 {\textgreater} 0.60, {NSE} {\textgreater} 0.50, and {PBIAS} ≤ ±15\% for watershed-scale models. Model performance at the watershed scale can be evaluated as “satisfactory” if monthly R2 {\textgreater} 0.40 and {NSE} {\textgreater} 0.45 and daily, monthly, or annual {PBIAS} ≤ ±20\% for sediment; monthly R2 {\textgreater} 0.40 and {NSE} {\textgreater} 0.35 and daily, monthly, or annual {PBIAS} ≤ ±30\% for phosphorus (P); and monthly R2 {\textgreater} 0.30 and {NSE} {\textgreater} 0.35 and daily, monthly, or annual {PBIAS} ≤ ±30\% for nitrogen (N). For {RSR}, we recommend that previously published {PEC} be used as detailed in this article. We also recommend that these {PEC} be used primarily for the four models for which there were adequate data, and used only with caution for other models. These {PEC} can be adjusted within acceptable bounds based on additional considerations, such as quality and quantity of available measured data, spatial and temporal scales, and project scope and magnitude, and updated based on the framework presented herein.

In order to address these challenges, the scientific community needs to create improved large-scale datasets and more flexible data structures that enable the integration of information across and within spatial scales; develop new and advanced models that support the assessment of longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity; and provide an accessible modeling environment for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. As a contribution, we here present a new modeling framework that integrates hydrographic baseline data at a global scale (enhanced {HydroSHEDS} layers and coupled datasets) with new modeling tools, specifically a river network routing model ({HydroROUT}) that is currently under development. The resulting ‘hydro-spatial fabric’ is designed to provide an avenue for advanced hydro-ecological applications at large scales in a consistent and highly versatile way. Preliminary results from case studies to assess human impacts on water quality and the effects of dams on river fragmentation and downstream flow regulation illustrate the potential of this combined data-and-modeling framework to conduct novel research in the fields of aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, geo-statistical modeling, or pollution and health risk assessments. The global scale outcomes are at a previously unachieved spatial resolution of 500 m and can thus support local planning and decision making in many of the world's large river basins.

	abstract = {To study the Earth system and to better understand the implications of global environmental change, there is a growing need for large-scale hydrographic data sets that serve as prerequisites in a variety of analyses and applications, ranging from regional watershed and freshwater conservation planning to global hydrological, climate, biogeochemical, and land surface modeling. Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped. In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape. The new product, known as {HydroSHEDS} (Hydrological Data and Maps Based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales), provides this information at a resolution and quality unachieved by previous global data sets, such as {HYDRO}1k [U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}), 2000].},

Version 1.0 of {HydroATLAS} offers data for 56 variables, partitioned into 281 individual attributes and organized in six categories: hydrology; physiography; climate; land cover \& use; soils \& geology; and anthropogenic influences. {HydroATLAS} derives the hydro-environmental characteristics by aggregating and reformatting original data from well-established global digital maps, and by accumulating them along the drainage network from headwaters to ocean outlets. The attributes are linked to hierarchically nested sub-basins at multiple scales, as well as to individual river reaches, both extracted from the global {HydroSHEDS} database at 15 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}500 m) resolution. The sub-basin and river reach information is offered in two companion datasets: {BasinATLAS} and {RiverATLAS}.

The approach is generally assumed to be reliable at lower elevations (below 3500 m above sea level, a.s.l) where air temperature (Ta) relates well to the energy inputs driving melt. We question this approach in High Mountain Asia ({HMA}). We study in-situ meteorological drivers of glacial ablation at two sites in central Nepal, between 2013 and 2017, using data from six automatic weather stations ({AWS}). During the monsoon, surface melt dominates ablation processes at lower elevations (between 4950 and 5380 m a.s.l.). As net shortwave radiation ({SWnet}) is the main energy input at the glacier surface, albedo (α) and cloudiness play key roles while being highly variable in space and time. For these cases only, ablation can be calculated with a {TI} model, or with an Enhanced {TI} ({ETI}) model that includes a shortwave radiation ({SW}) scheme and site specific ablation factors. In the ablation zone during other seasons and during all seasons in the accumulation zone, sublimation and other wind-driven ablation processes also contribute to mass loss, and remain unresolved with {TI} or {ETI} methods.},

Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further reﬁnement and development.},

	abstract = {We use meteorological data from two automatic weather stations ({AWS}) on Juncal Norte Glacier, central Chile, to investigate the glacier–climate interaction and to test ablation models of different complexity. The semi-arid Central Andes are characterized by dry summers, with precipitation close to zero, low relative humidity and intense solar radiation. We show that katabatic forcing is dominant both on the glacier tongue and in the fore field, and that low humidity and absence of clouds cause strong radiative cooling of the glacier surface. Surface albedo is basically constant for snow and ice, because of the scarcity of solid precipitation. The energy balance of the glacier is simulated for a 2-month period in austral summer using two models of different complexity, which differ in the inclusion of the heat conduction flux into the snowpack and in the parameterization of the incoming longwave radiation. Net shortwave radiation is the dominant component of the energy balance. The sensible heat flux is always positive, while both the net longwave radiation and latent heat flux are negative. Neglecting the subsurface heat flux and corresponding variations in surface temperature leads to an overestimation of ablation of 2\% over a total of 3695 mm water equivalent (w.e.) at the end of the season. Correct modelling of incoming longwave radiation is crucial, and we suggest that parameterizations based on vapour pressure and air temperature should be used rather than on computed cloud amount. We also used an enhanced temperature-index model incorporating the shortwave radiation flux, which has two empirical parameters. We apply it both with values of parameters obtained for Alpine glaciers and recalibrated on Juncal Norte. The model recalibrated against the correct energy balance simulations performs very well. The model parameters respond to the meteorological conditions typical of this climatic setting. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-{contentHeaderColor}"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Despite their importance for sea-level rise, seasonal water availability, and as a source of geohazards, mountain glaciers are one of the few remaining subsystems of the global climate system for which no globally applicable, open source, community-driven model exists. Here we present the Open Global Glacier Model ({OGGM}), developed to provide a modular and open-source numerical model framework for simulating past and future change of any glacier in the world. The modeling chain comprises data downloading tools (glacier outlines, topography, climate, validation data), a preprocessing module, a mass-balance model, a distributed ice thickness estimation model, and an ice-flow model. The monthly mass balance is obtained from gridded climate data and a temperature index melt model. To our knowledge, {OGGM} is the first global model to explicitly simulate glacier dynamics: the model relies on the shallow-ice approximation to compute the depth-integrated flux of ice along multiple connected flow lines. In this paper, we describe and illustrate each processing step by applying the model to a selection of glaciers before running global simulations under idealized climate forcings. Even without an in-depth calibration, the model shows very realistic behavior. We are able to reproduce earlier estimates of global glacier volume by varying the ice dynamical parameters within a range of plausible values. At the same time, the increased complexity of {OGGM} compared to other prevalent global glacier models comes at a reasonable computational cost: several dozen glaciers can be simulated on a personal computer, whereas global simulations realized in a supercomputing environment take up to a few hours per century. Thanks to the modular framework, modules of various complexity can be added to the code base, which allows for new kinds of model intercomparison studies in a controlled environment. Future developments will add new physical processes to the model as well as automated calibration tools. Extensions or alternative parameterizations can be easily added by the community thanks to comprehensive documentation. {OGGM} spans a wide range of applications, from ice–climate interaction studies at millennial timescales to estimates of the contribution of glaciers to past and future sea-level change. It has the potential to become a self-sustained community-driven model for global and regional glacier evolution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The simplest model involves linear regression of mass balance time series on temperature and precipitation data at stations close to the glacier but we prefer the degree-day model. This model uses temperature and precipitation to calculate snow accumulation, snow and ice melting, and possible refreezing of meltwater at regular altitude intervals on a glacier. Model parameters are still somewhat uncertain and are established for individual glaciers by tuning the model mass balance as a function of altitude to fit observed data. The model has been applied to 37 glaciers in different parts of the world so far and some details are given for Storglaciären to illustrate the approach. The sensitivity of modelled mass balance to a +1°C temperature increase shows a wide range for the 37 glaciers from about 0.1 to 1.3 m water a-1. Sub-polar glaciers have lower temperature sensitivities, and maritime and tropical glaciers have higher sensitivities.},

Here, we perform the first-ever glacier evolution projections based on deep learning by modelling the 21st century glacier evolution in the French Alps. By the end of the century, we predict a glacier volume loss between 75 and 88\%. Deep learning captures a nonlinear response of glaciers to air temperature and precipitation, improving the representation of extreme mass balance rates compared to linear statistical and temperature-index models. Our results confirm an over-sensitivity of temperature-index models, often used by large-scale studies, to future warming. We argue that such models can be suitable for steep mountain glaciers. However, glacier projections under low-emission scenarios and the behaviour of flatter glaciers and ice caps are likely to be biased by mass balance models with linear sensitivities, introducing long-term biases in sea-level rise and water resources projections.},

In the remaining basins, this tipping point has already been passed. Peak water occurs later in basins with larger glaciers and higher ice-cover fractions. Typically, future glacier runoff increases in early summer but decreases in late summer. Although most of the 56 basins have less than 2\% ice coverage, by 2100 one-third of them might experience runoff decreases greater than 10\% due to glacier mass loss in at least one month of the melt season, with the largest reductions in central Asia and the Andes. We conclude that, even in large-scale basins with minimal ice-cover fraction, the downstream hydrological effects of continued glacier wastage can be substantial, but the magnitudes vary greatly among basins and throughout the melt season.},

	abstract = {A warming climate is associated with increasing hydroclimatic extremes, which are often interconnected through complex processes, prompting their concurrence and/or succession, and causing compound extreme events. It is critical to analyze the risks of compound events, given their disproportionately high adverse impacts. To account for the variability in two or more hydroclimatic variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and their dependence, a rising number of publications focuses on multivariate analysis, among which the notion of copula-based probability distribution has attracted tremendous interest. Copula is a mathematical function that expresses the joint cumulative probability distribution of multiple variables. Our focus is to re-emphasize the fundamental requirements and limitations of applying copulas. Confusion about these requirements may lead to misconceptions and pitfalls, which can potentially compromise the robustness of risk analyses for environmental processes and natural hazards. We conducted a systematic literature review of copulas, as a prominent tool in the arsenal of multivariate methods used for compound event analysis, and underpinned them with a hydroclimatic case study in Sweden to illustrate a practical approach to copula-based modeling. Here, we (1) provide end-users with a didactic overview of necessary requirements, statistical assumptions and consequential limitations of copulas, (2) synthesize common perceptions and practices, and (3) offer a user-friendly decision support framework to employ copulas, thereby support researchers and practitioners in addressing hydroclimatic hazards, hence demystify what can be an area of confusion.

The model uses temperature data extrapolated from nearby climate stations, and is tuned by varying precipitation to make the model fit the observed distribution of mass balance with altitude. Once the model is tuned, the effect of temperature change is simulated by recalculating the mass balance with the same parameters as before, but with a temperature increase of 1°C throughout the year. The largest mass-balance changes, involving increased ablation of {\textgreater} 1 m w.e. a−1 °C−1, occur at the snout, with a progressively smaller increase with altitude. The area-averaged sensitivities for the five glaciers are −0.7 to −0.9 m w.e. a−1 °C−1. If annual precipitation also increased by 20\% it would partly offset the effect of the 1°C higher temperatures but could not compensate for it.},

On the basis of long term data from 348 meteorological and glaciological stations, the annual distribution of precipitation in different regions and elevational zones of the Tien Shan was calculated. Major climatic features are the entrance of moisture during spring-summer, small winter precipitation, decrease of precipitation towards the east and the center of the mountains or with distance up valleys, and increase of precipitation with altitude up to crest-lines of ranges. Annual total evaporation from snow can be 50–60 mm per year, reaching 30 percent of snow accumulation. Four main groups of rivers were identified: rivers with mainly snow nourishment, rivers with mainly glacial nourishment, rivers with mainly rain nourishment, and rivers with mainly ground water nourishment. Coefficient of runoff variation in Tien Shan's rivers is about 0.20, and coefficient of glacial runoff variation is about 0.15. Glacial runoff is 15–20 percent of the total volume of river runoff.},

Scenario runs were produced for a climate change caused by the doubling of atmospheric {CO}2 as predicted by the {GISS} global circulation model and assuming a 50\% reduction of glaciation extent, as well as a complete loss of glaciation. Agreement of the results was best for runs based on 50\% glaciation loss, where both models predict an increase in spring and summer runoff compared to current levels. Scenarios for complete loss of glaciation predict an increase in spring runoff levels, followed by lower runoff levels for July and August. Model predictions differ concerning the degree of reduction of late summer runoff. These scenarios are sensitive to model simulation of basin precipitation, as well as to reduction of glaciation extent.},

	abstract = {Newly developed approaches based on satellite altimetry and gravity measurements provide promising results on glacier dynamics in the Pamir-Himalaya but cannot resolve short-term natural variability at regional and finer scale. We contribute to the ongoing debate by upscaling a hydrological model that we calibrated for the central Pamir. The model resolves the spatiotemporal variability in runoff over the entire catchment domain with high efficiency. We provide relevant information about individual components of the hydrological cycle and quantify short-term hydrological variability. For validation, we compare the modeled total water storages ({TWS}) with {GRACE} (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data with a very good agreement where {GRACE} uncertainties are low. The approach exemplifies the potential of {GRACE} for validating even regional scale hydrological applications in remote and hard to access mountain regions. We use modeled time series of individual hydrological components to characterize the effect of climate variability on the hydrological cycle. We demonstrate that glaciers play a twofold role by providing roughly 35\% of the annual runoff of the Panj River basin and by effectively buffering runoff both during very wet and very dry years. The modeled glacier mass balance ({GMB}) of −0.52 m w.e. yr−1 (2002–2013) for the entire catchment suggests significant reduction of most Pamiri glaciers by the end of this century. The loss of glaciers and their buffer functionality in wet and dry years could not only result in reduced water availability and increase the regional instability, but also increase flood and drought hazards.},

              High-resolution climatic data are essential to many questions and applications in environmental research and ecology. Here we develop and implement a new semi-mechanistic downscaling approach for daily precipitation estimate that incorporates high resolution (30 arcsec,
              ≈
              1 km) satellite-derived cloud frequency. The downscaling algorithm incorporates orographic predictors such as wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. We apply the method to the {ERA}5 precipitation archive and {MODIS} monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily gridded precipitation time series in 1 km resolution for the years 2003 onward. Comparison of the predictions with existing gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an improvement in the spatio-temporal performance of the downscaled data in predicting precipitation. Regional scrutiny of the cloud cover correction from the continental United States further indicates that {CHELSA}-{EarthEnv} performs well in comparison to other precipitation products. The {CHELSA}-{EarthEnv} daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy compared with a large improvement in the spatial accuracy especially in complex terrain.},

	abstract = {Siloed-approaches may fuel the misguided development of hydropower and subsequent target-setting under the sustainable development goals ({SDGs}). While hydropower development in the Indus basin is vital to ensure energy security ({SDG}7), it needs to be balanced with water use for fulfilling food ({SDG}2) and water ({SDG}6) security. Existing methods to estimate hydropower potential generally focus on: only one class of potential, a methodological advance for either of hydropower siting, sizing, or costing of one site, or the ranking of a portfolio of projects. A majority of them fall short in addressing sustainability. Hence, we develop a systematic framework for the basin-scale assessment of the sustainable hydropower potential by integrating considerations of the water-energy-food nexus, disaster risk, climate change, environmental protection, and socio-economic preferences. Considering the case of the upper Indus, the framework is developed by combining advances in literature, insights from local hydropower practitioners and over 30 datasets to represent real-life challenges to sustainable hydropower development, while distinguishing between small and large plants for two run-of-river plant configurations. The framework first addresses theoretical potential and successively constrains this further by stepwise inclusion of technical, economical, and sustainability criteria to obtain the sustainable exploitable hydropower potential. We conclude that sustainable hydropower potential in complex basins such as the Indus goes far beyond the hydrological boundary conditions. Our framework enables the careful inclusion of factors beyond the status-quo technological and economic criterions to guide policymakers in hydropower development decisions in the Indus and beyond. Future work will implement the framework to quantify the different hydropower potential classes and explore adaptation pathways to balance {SDG}7 with the other interlinked {SDGs} in the Indus.},

	abstract = {The hydrological response to climate change in mountainous basins manifests itself at varying spatial and temporal scales, ranging from catchment to large river basin scale and from sub-daily to decade and century scale. To robustly assess the 21st century climate change impact for hydrology in entire High Mountain Asia ({HMA}) at a wide range of scales, we use a high resolution cryospheric-hydrological model covering 15 upstream {HMA} basins to quantify the compound effects of future changes in precipitation and temperature based on the range of climate change projections in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate model ensemble. Our analysis reveals contrasting responses for {HMA}'s rivers, dictated by their hydrological regimes. At the seasonal scale, the earlier onset of melting causes a shift in the magnitude and peak of water availability, to earlier in the year. At the decade to century scale, after an initial increase, the glacier melt declines by the mid or end of the century except for the Tarim river basin, where it continues to increase. Despite a large variability in hydrological regimes across {HMA}'s rivers, our results indicate relatively consistent climate change responses across {HMA} in terms of total water availability at decadal time scales. Although total water availability increases for the headwaters, changes in seasonality and magnitude may diverge widely between basins and need to be addressed while adapting to future changes in a region where food security, energy security as well as biodiversity, and the livelihoods of many depend on water from {HMA}.},
