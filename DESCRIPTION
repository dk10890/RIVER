Description: Currently, a relatively complete dataset of the Chirchik River Basin with decadal and monthly data on discharge, precipitation and temperature is included. 
The plan is to extend the data record to also include data from Chu and Talas rivers and from Amu Darya and Syr Darya, etc. The package is now also capable of basic
GIS operations, including the extraction of hourly precipitation and temperature ERA5 data from NetCDF / raster bricks data.
