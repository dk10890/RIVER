Description: riversCentralAsia is an R Package with helper functions to load, manage and analyze hydrometeorological data from Central Asia. Furthermore, it contains some workhorse function to prepare input data for RSMINERVE (www.crealp.ch) which is a hydrological-hydraulic modeling suite that can be used for river basin planning and management purposes and climate impact analysis, among other things. It also contains a bias correction and downscaling workflow of the CHELSA V21 high resolution climatologies and CMIP6 climate projections.
